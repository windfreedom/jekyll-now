Invest in big markets. It's a venture statement that's repeated so often that it's almost clich√©. Marc Andreesseen says you should do it. So does Andy Rachleff. And of course, the master of VC himself, Don Valentine, originated the idea that as a VC, one should invest in startups that are targeting big markets.

The reasons why are numerous - I'd encourage you to just go read the posts I linked to - but they can basically be summarized as so. A great market, one where there are lots of customers and they are willing to pay for a solution to their problem, pulls a product out of a company. The product just has to be barely functional, meeting the bare minimum of requirements to fit the market need. The team simply has to be competent enough to get that basic, functional product out the door. For startups, who never have the resources.

That all made sense to me when I first read those posts. However, Valentine, is also fond of saying that he _doesn't_ invest in startups

This line between market creation and market entry, fundamentally new markets as opposed to existing ones, confused me. The princple reason for this confusion is becasue depending on the level of abstraction defined, almost any market can be said to both be new or already existing. Let me give you an example to illustrate this principle. Google. Because Google is a two-sided interaction platform, it actually has two products: the search engine we all use daily, and a keyword-based advertising product that gets shown against the results from the search engine. If you define the market Google operates in as "keyword advertising on the Internet", then Google _did_ create a market (or at least entered a new one).  If you zoom out and say the market was "Internet Search", they probably didn't - AltaVista and Yahoo did that. In this case though, another problem emerges to challenge the "invest in big markets' thesis - the market, as quantified by number of dollars that could be made from internet search - was puny at the time, yet Google was still a great investment. It's in fact an investment that Sequoia, the market-oriented VC firm, made. If you move up a layer of abstraction and define Google's market as "Digital Advertising" on the advertisers side, they again didn't create the market, but they did _expand_ it considerably. On the user side, if you zoom all the way out and define the market as "information search", then the market _definitely_ existed prior to Google. 

The Google example isn't unique - you can play the game with almost any new startup. Any new startup, if you define the market narrowly enough, is creating a market (or entering a new one). I call this the **abstraction problem**. 

There's another problem too. If we analyze the posts I linked to above, all of them analyze the past and look for explanations. Let's take Marc Andreessen's examples of great markets: search keyword advertising, Internet auctions, and TCP/IP routers. _Ex post_ of course, it's very easy to see that there were lots of paying customers for each of these markets. But _ex ante_, there were not a lot customers in those markets; internet auctions were made fun of particularly harshly for this very problem. So yes, invest in big markets is a good investment tactic, looking backwards. But it relies on being able to identify markets that are going to be big _ex ante_. I call this the **timing problem**.

## From First Principles

What is a market? I like Geoffrey Moore's definition from _Crossing the Chasm_. A market is "A set of _actual or potential customers_ for a given **set of products or services** who have a common **set of needs or wants**". 

I bolded and italicized the three key parts of the definition that can be used to help us with both the abstraction problem. Simply, markets can be defined by a combination of the one of the italicized elements and one or more of the bolded elemets.
That is, it makes sense to talk about actual (or potential) customers for a set of products (which can serve one or many needs). It also makes sense to talk about a market as a set of actual (or potential) customers for a set of needs/problems/wants (which can be met by multiple competing products). And, most narrowly, it also makes sense to speak about a market as a set of actual (or potential) customers for a specific product meeting a specific set of needs/wants. We most often talk about markets as defined by the actual customers for a given product category or set of related product categories. But, in my mind - and we'll come back to this later - a more useful way to view markets is through the lense of both the actual and potential customers who have a particular need/want. 

With this in mind, what might classify as creating a new market?

Well firstly, let's start with the actual vs. potential parameter. A new market can be created when a startup "expands" a market by accessing customers who couldn't previously use a product or meet a need. Christensens' "new market" disruption theory features this definition well, defining new market disruption as a process by which a startup offers a new solution to a problem/need/want that can be accessed by a group of previously _potential_ customers due to increased usability, lowered price, new portability, etc.

Secondly, although rare, new problems/needs/wants can be created that previously did not exist, particularly as a result of problems/needs arising from other technologies, but also because a product arises that itself unearths a need that people did not know they needed solved (a 'latent' need per se). Multi-protocol Routing, made famous by Cisco, is a great example of this. The growth of LANs around the country, in which each network used different local protocols, introduced the problem whereby computers on the same campus couldn't exchange information (e.g. no email). Cisco therefore attacked a truly new market. In this case, this new want/need can be served by new or existing product and/or service categories. It's usually the case that these emerging wants are solved by new product categories. Thus, it makes sense to say a startup creates a market if it launches a new product category that meets a need/problem/want that truly did not exist before.  

Thirdly, and most commonly, new product and service categories (i.e. I'm not referring to say, a new model of car, but rather a fundamentally new category of product, as recognized by society) emerge all the time, even if they target existing needs/wants. Take the emergence of electric lighting in the late 19th Century. The need/want was the same as for gas lighting - illumination of businesses and/or the home. But the product categories (and technological system) neeeded to meet that want was radically different. 

The framework I described above is advantageous because it's flexible. For example, one startup that Marc Andreessen argued 'created' a market was VMWare. The product, he argued, was "so profoundly transformative out of the gate that it catalyzed a whole new movement toward operating system virtualization, which turns out to be a monster market". I think this falls into category #2. No one knew they needed to virtualize operating systems in order to  

So how does it reframe our discussion of that oft-repeated venture aphorism we discussed above?





 1. Invest in companies that can potentially access a large number of customers who would use some existing solution for a need/problem/want but cannot for some reason (cost, accessibility, expertise, etc.).
 2. Invest in companies that target new 



What about the timing problem?
