At long last, after close to a year of entry rumors and key hiring in its new "1492" group, including that of [Martin Levine from Iora Health](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/amazon-adds-top-iora-health-physician-to-healthcare-team.html), Amazon has officially [annouced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130005676/en/Amazon-Berkshire-Hathaway-JPMorgan-Chase-partner-U.S) its intentions to do..._something_ in healthcare. Officially, they say they are teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan "with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs....through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints". Problem is - as many skeptical health-technology commentators have noted - it isn't exactly divulging details about what it intends to do, and because we have nothing to critically analyze, it's quite easy to either hail or dismiss Amazon's triumvirate based solely on one's intellectual priors. But still, the annoucement is very interesting even with only scant details available, both because we all _want_ them to succeed (who does't want lower healthcare costs?), but also because Amazon has a verifiable history of approaching new industries and finding winning strategies in them. 

But how should we begin speculating in a way that gives us even a chance at making those speculations intellectually useful? I see 2 ways forward: 
1. Analyze the strategies by Amazon has approached new industries and product-markets in the past. 
2. Understand how employers have attempted to curb their employees healthcare costs in the past.

With those two pieces of background in mind, we can attempt to at least understand what Amazon is likely to try and understand whether it's likely to work or not. 

## Amazon, Primitives, and Adaptation

Let's start with Amazon. Amazon is a hard company to thematically come to terms with. At first glance their core businesses of AWS, E-commerce logistics platform, as well as now its efforts in 'smart' consumer electronics and groceries,appear eclectically put together and very different from one another.  However, two [fantastic](https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/) [articles](https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/) by Ben Thompson help shed light on three key traits that Amazon's business ventures seem to share. 

1. Amazon has a **goal** of taking a cut of all economic activity - and is willing to be flexible on both the **strategies** and **tactics** necessary 
2.
