Every venture capitalist has a unique way of thinking about the success and failure of startups. For example, Sequoia has a famous presentation that details theirs. Generally, though I've found them to be 

Before I get into defining the framework, I have to define a couple of key terms that are necessary to understand what I'm talking about. If you read my last article, you'll remember that I like to define markets not in terms of the dollars spent on a particular product category, but by the  dollars spent on the problem,need,or want that a certain set of products meets.

The reason I do this is becasue it allows me to create a clear typology of startups based on the market that they are targeting - that is, the type of problem they solve. We begin with a startup and a novel product category (which I will define very broadly; a startup trying to commercialize a product that exists, but paired with a novel revenue model, e.g. Salesforce's pioneering of the SaaS business model counts in my framework as a 'new product category') that it hopes to sell with the goal of maximizing the firm's cash flows. 

Then, I categorize startups into 3 types, based on the problem that they are solving. The first category of startups consists of companies that are targeting an **existing problem, want, or need of a set of consumers with a novel product category**. In this sense, that the market 'exists' indicates that consumers are _aware of the problem, want, or need they have_, are _meeting that want/need with whatever existing solutions they are able to access_, and  _will recognize if a new product category solves that problem_. Alternatively, startups can target 'new markets'. There are 2 ways they can do this. The first involves a **startup seeling a new product that solves an truly new need or want (one that  did not exist before) or is so revolutionary in its capabilities, that it unearths a latent need, problem, or want in individuals**. An example of the former was Cisco's multiprotocol router, which solved the problem of incompatible communication accross LANs, a new problem that didn't exist prior to the growth of LANs(often, fundamentally new problems are created out of the growth of other new products). An example of the latter is VMWare's OS Virtualization product, which was so revolutionary that it convinced CIOs to change their business practices becacuse they were made aware - by VMWare's product - of a new want. The second way a startup can target a new market involves a **startup providing a solution for those _potential_ customers who have a need or want that already exists, but who can't use an existing solution for some reason (cost, complexity, location, etc.)**. This is described very lucidly in Clayton Christensen's book _The Innovator's Solution_. Basically, when targeting existing markets, a startup must 'shift' spend from existing solutions to their new product category. When targeting 'new markets', a startup has to create spend. 

There are a couple of things to note about this typology. Firstly, I like this typology because, so far as I can see, it's _completely exhaustive_. Because it's defined from first principles, there _shouldn't_ be a startup that doesn't fit into one of those three categories (although I welcome attempts to break it). Secondly, the categories are _not_, nor should they be, mutually exclusive. The best product categories, the one that have been the foundation for companies worth tens of billions of dollars, eventually end up falling into at least two, sometimes all three categories. From the perspective of a venture investor though, what really matters is which category the startup's product category fits into _first_, at the very earliest stages of its development. It's very difficult to project when a product category can be so transformative as to fundamentally solve many problems for many target groups of custoemrs, and thus it's probably not good to count on that happening. Rather the initial market the startup targets should support venture-scale outcomes. Thirdly, the lines between the categories can get a bit fuzzy, mainly based on what one considers to be the actual problem/need/want that is being solved. This problem - which I call the problem of abstraction - is tough to get around since capitalism is inherently a social process and thus, the definitions of problems aren't objective, but defined by a social process.  Lastly, another reason why explicitly mapping the typology of different categories of startups is important is because the factors that govern the success of startups I think will drastically change depending on which type of market the startup's product category attempts to sell into. 

The first factor that gets drastically affected, and thus bears me explaining before I get into the description of the framework properly, is the type of competitors that a startup will face. In fact, one of the reasons I made this F/W was because I didn't like that the words 'incumbent' and 'competitor' were tossed out with imprecision. I define 3 types of competitors that a startup may or may not have to face. The first are **indirect incumbents**. These firms market products that form the existing set of solutions for a given problem, need, or want. For Uber's ridesharing product, taxi drivers (and their operating companies) were the indirect incumbent. As you can see, there is no requirement that incumbents be large, profitable corporations with a strong engineering or product development capability sets - they _can_ be of course, but there is no requirement as such in my framework. In Porter's Five Forces F/W, considering the startup as the protagonist of analysis, the indirect incumbents be analagous to substitutes to the startups' product category; to the incumbents', the startup's product category is the substitute to their products. The second type of incumbents are **adjacent** incumbents. Adjacent incumbents define a broad set of players that make products and services that operate in adjacent industries to the startup. For Netscape, one adjacent incumbent was Microsoft. Microsoft's core product, Windows and Office, did not solve the same problem that browsers did, but Microsoft operated in an adjacent market. These incumbents, while not always dominant and profitable (they might be struggling to survive and thus forced into the startups market), often are. They also are usually marked by similar capability sets as the startup, which makes them extremely dangerous opponents - even if they are not operating in your market now, they pose a legitimate threat of entry. For example, when people speak of Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., as competitors, most of the time they are referring to their capabilities as adjacent incumbents. Young startups are probably not competing against Google's Search Product directly or indirectly (as substitutes to it), but Google could, if it decided to, build the product category the startup is also building, only with many more technical and monetary resoures.  Additionally, note that an adjacent incumbent can also be an indirect incumbent and vice versa. The last competitor category consists not even of incumbent per se, but consist of **direct competitors**, companies (often startups) that compete in the same market as a startup. 

With these types of competitors and markets in mind, we can move to the framework. I'll note at the outset, that this is _not_ a people-centric framework. Rather this framework tries to 


To me, the success of a startup comes down to 2 big categories of risk that must be dispatched: **Displacement Risk** (I also call this **"Entry Risk"**) and **Barrier Risk**. Displacement/Entry risk to me answers the question: "Can this company make something that a lot of people will buy, even if that requires a large shift in spend away from existing products?". It is about whether a startup can establish product/market fit so strong that the startup will be thrown into a 'tornado' of demand (to steal a term from Geoffrey Moore). The problem however, is that _even if_ that tornado of demand hits, there is no guarantee that the startup will make any money. If there really is tornado of demand, firms will initially make money hand over fist. But, without a source of competitive advantage, the return they earn will start crashing back to earth as fast-followers enter to get a bite of that tornado. The second question tries to get at the heart of this conundrum. How many winners can a given tornado support? Any at all? If there are winners, how can we predict whether it will be the startup that wins, or whether fast followers (be them adjacent incumbents or indirect incumbents) leapfrog the startup?  

Let's start with the first question. 

## Displacement/Entry Risk 

As Sam Altman, Paul George, and YC is apt to say, if you don't make something people want, you don't have a company. That is true and the first thing any startup has to do is verify that the dogs are eating the dog food - that people want what you're selling. Marc Andreessen called this concept "product-market fit". 

But to a venture investor, at the time of investment, often before there's solid evidence of product-market fit (e.g. in some startups, notably deep tech startups, there _is_ no Series A metric of PMF anyways), the question of 'do people want the product' can get so much attention that it masks a subtle but related question: **"Can the startup's product category displace the indirect incumbents's solutions in a way that renders them unable to respond and therefore forces them to abandon the product category?** Note that this is less a question about the specific startup (unless it really is the only startup marketing a particular product category) and more about the _product category_ the startup is pioneering. It's about the competition between product categories and whether a new product category to meet a defined want/need can displace the solutions that already exist. 

This question is _vitally_ important for startups launching new product categories that meet existing wants/needs, albeit usually in a competely novel manner. In thee cases, there are existing solutions to the problems that a startups' product also solves, and thus many indirect incumbents that the startup is 'indirectly' competing against. Note however, that companies that are targeting new markets - particularly those when a new problem/need arises or is unearthed - _don't_ have to deal with this aspect of displacement. That's one reason why going after new markets can be, while risky, also very powerful. There's far _more_ risk around the first question - will the dogs eat the dog food? - will be answered affirmatively, but  no risk around whether the startups's product category presents enough benefits to displace existing solutions. The name of the game is convincing spend to appear on a solution, not having to drag the spend from one category to another. Remember, startups are small, not-very-well financed (even in this era) companies, and thus it's hard for to compete against _everyone_ at once.  Shielding the startup from having to displace existing solution sets to a given problem/need buys startups time to grow unhindered by immediate competition.

But unfortunately, not all startups are lucky enough or have a transformative enough product to create markets on their own. What about startups going after already defined wants/needs, but with a new product category? Some of the most important companies ever - notably General Electric, and even Fairchild Semiconductor - got started doing exactly this. So it seems that we should try to come up with an answer. 

This is where I think Christensen's Theory of Disruptive Innovation presents a helpful, if incomplete, guide. Christensens's theory describes one way new product categories can displace old ones. He notes that when a new solution to a problems arrives, it's can be cheaper, worse than the existing product category along one set of performance dimensions, but much better along alternative performance dimensions. This set of characteristics allows the new product category to access a set of potential customers. Initially, it can get at these potential customers because serving them would violate the economics of the existing product category - they are outside the purview of indirect incumbents. Then as the performance trajectory of the new product category improves, it can ultimately 'suck' customers out of the old product category into the new one, leaving the old indirect incumbents out to dry. 

Now note that I'm cheating a bit here. I previously defined the act of "targeting potential customers who were unable to access an existing solution set but would like to", as creating a new market in my last article. So technically Christensen's Theory is an example of a company targeting a _new market_, which doesn't answer the question I posed. The princples however, are what matter here. As I mentioned at the end of the last piece, truly great product categories do a bit of all 3 catetgories of market entry or creation - they just do it in different orders.  Smartphones provide an example of where a new product category (smartphones, led by the iPhone) started by immediately displacing a whole _host_ of existing solutions (not just existing mobile phones) for existing needs/wants for an existing market, but ended up converting potential customers to actual customers as the product category got cheaper. Christensen's Theory is simply meant to demonstrate that product cateogry displacement and resulting spend shift _is_ possible.

So how should VCs think about whether a new product category is likely to displace existing solutions? Well first, as Christensen's lesson shows, if you can start out selling into a set of potential customers, who for some reason, are unable to access existing solutions (not necessarily because they're too expensive - for any reason really) - do it, because it will give the startup time to grow without having to shift spend much. But if not, the rule of thumb VCs like to say, is make sure your product category is 10x better or cheaper than existing solutions - or can get there. 10x might be an arbitrary number, but the point isn't the number so much as the idea that when you have to directly take on indirect incumbents, you better bring a new product category to the table so much better than existing solutions that it can overcome the barriers keeping the existing product category entrenched.

Unfortunately, no good treatment exists to discuss what these barriers are, and to provide any more depth than the "10X Better or Cheaper" rule. A lot of energy has gone into defining the barriers to entry within a given product-market, economies of scale, networking effects, cornered resources, brand, learning economies, etc. However, these sources of competitive advantage don't always apply when considering a battle between two product categories. I'm going to try though. 

The last question that I would want answers to regarding a startups' ability to enter a market is as follows: "Why aren't indiret or adjaent incumbents launching this product category as we speak?" 

## Barrier Risk 

So now you have a product that a lot of people want to buy. You've displaced the existing solutions if there are any, and you're in the classic 'tornado' of demand.. Just keep the foot on the gas until you're Google right? Unforunately, no. The good thing is that generally, the tornado of demand, especially if the market is large, brings tons of revenue to a startup. The bad thing is that to ensure that this revenue 59
