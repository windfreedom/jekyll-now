I've wanted to write about Oscar Health, the NYC-based health insurer, for a long time now. I've been following their progress for several years now and, like many others, am fascinated by the ambition of their vision. I was curious to see whether they could buck the trend of health innovation failure and become a durable, long-lasting company. 

It seems though that the company might have done most of my analysis for me. Oscar just released a comprehensive [report](https://www.hioscar.com/report) in which they discuss their vision for building a lasting health insurer and provide some pretty detailed data (relative to other venture-backed, private companies) that shows progress on achieving that vision.

Oscar is the poster-child of the new era of technology-enabled startups attempting to enter the healthcare industry. What started as the dream of current-CEO Mario Schlosser and his founding team has matured over the last 5 years into a full-blown health insurance company, covering close to 250,000 lives and projected to make $1.25 billion in revenue in 2018. It's captured the imagination of the public and members by promising everything that current inusurers don't: **simplicity and consumer delight.**

But even with those numbers and financial backing from some of Silicon Valley's smartest money (Google Ventures, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures, and Founders Fund to name a few early investors), Oscar has been met with skepticisim from most of the traditional healthcare community. Not just journalists, but really, really smart investors as well. And at first it's easy to agree with the doubters.

For one, Oscare represents a **bold** bet by investors on a business model that is anathema to model of companies investors typically fund. Insurance is a low margin business. By law, 80-85% of every dollar of revenue must be spent paying for members care, meaning the days of 40% gross margins in health insurance are in the past and single digit gross (not net) margins are a real possiblility.  Contrast this to framous venture investments like Salesforce and Google, which both have gross-margins closer to 60-80%. 

Additionally, health insurance is generally not a pleasant industry for new entrants - especially when the new founding team has no industry background. Even just getting a product to the market in the health insurance industry requires building a network of physicians that meet network adequacy laws - it's no good having a network without any surgical oncologists in it! Building that network required Oscar to actually sit down with providers and hammer out contracts which determined what price Oscar was going to pay for provider services. Knowing what those contracts look like, what good benchmarks are, and actually getting physicians to partner with you are all hard to do without any experience. And to top it all off, you don't get consumer leeway in this business. Mistakes can permanently stain the reputation of a company and make it hard to acquire customers. 

The competitive dynamics of the industry didn't look all that attractive either. Health insurance is an extremely concentrated industry where scale has been the primary route to competitive advantage. It's dominated by 4-5 major players who have either been around since the begining of the health insurance industry in the 1930s or latched on to the growth of HMO plans in the late 1980s to get to scale before diversifying. UnitedHealthGroup, Anthem, Aetna, Humana, and Cigns all generate over $30 Billion in revenue, have market capitalizations exceeding $20 Billion, and are thus formidable competitors (e.g. see my piece on UHG's outpatient strategy here). Without the number of members that the incumbents could bring to bear, individuals struggled to see how Oscar could construct a network in which they wouldn't be a price taker to increasingly concentrated provider systems - suffering large losses as a result. 

And lastly, unlike the profitable Medicare Advantage market segment (ARPU is around 2x the average individual ARPU depeding on risk adjustment, churn is lower), in which  many new startups (e.g. Devoted Health, Clover Health) have launched, Oscar launched on the Obamacare individual exchanges. For the first few years at least, these exchanges were bloodbaths for insurers. [United](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170418/NEWS/170419876), [Humana](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/14/humana-says-it-plans-to-pull-out-of-obamacare-exchanges-in-2018.html), Aetna and the other large insurers pulled out citing huge losses of up to $1 Billion over two years (although [the Florida Blues](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160615/NEWS/160619946) in particular have noted a 17% gross margin - which for the ACA exchanges is very impressive indeed). The economics of these exchanges seemed at odds with Oscar's product's strategy. Consumers are price sensistive, churn is high (commercial markets generally keep customers for ~1 year, no more), and risk-adjustment means that an insurer can be penalized for having too healthy a class of individuals. Those three variables don't look great when you plug them into a LTV model.

To put it simply, Oscar looked like a bad bet for those who prioritize fast growth and high margins above all else. 

And yet, little-by little Oscar started to do the small things that are important to run a successful health insurance businesss correctly. A quick gander about their blog demonstrates how well they've come to understand the business they're in. 

- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/this-is-not-a-bill-oscars-journey-to-create-a-better-eob) they describe their approach to creating a better Explanation of Benefits statement (which is the letter you get from your insurance company after you use services; it's usually unreadably complicated).
- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/better-claims-processing-better-health-care-experience) they explain how claims processing systems work.
- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/gabe-switches-doctors-a-health-care-story) they explain how difficult it was for one of their own executives to switch doctors, illustrating some of the problems patients face when trying to navigate the health care system.
- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/connecting-the-dots-with-the-clinical-dashboard) they describe their clinical dashboard that both providers and members can access. 
- They've made [using telemedicine](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/virtual-care-future-smart-fast-interconnected-alan-warren/) a much bigger priority than most insurers 
-  Many insurers can't even properly maintain provider lists because the data about providers they use is so unreliable. So Oscar tried to design a better provider directory [here](https://medium.com/oscar-tech/building-a-doctor-directory-f241abfffae6)
- And topping it all off, they describe their approach to network building [here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/a-new-kind-of-health-insurance-network).

I recently got to visit the Oscar HQ in SoHo, and it's obvious that they've put together a stunning team. Everyone I met with was humble and honest about what they did know, and what they didn't; what capabilities they were bootstrapping, building and which ones remained outside the company's hands. The mix of individuals from traditional healthcare backgrounds( e.g. former operational leaders from HCA) former policy researchers and analysts, economists, actual doctors, (even a physiscist turned data scientist!) all combined with amazing technical talent, was amazing to see first-hand. The mix is perfectly keeping with what one might expect from an insurer that also happens to be a software company. And everyone at the company that I met with spoke about how much they still wanted to learn about their industry. If I had to evaluate the company from the standpoint of personnell alone, I'd immediately invest. 

The problem is, as strategy legend Michael Porter loves to point out - **[operational excellence is not strategy](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62a5/6cb47ec0a181da67358662446ab7d544c01f.pdf)**. Rather, irrespective of the industry chosen or product/service marketed, for a firm to  achieve sustained returns above the cost of capital and above those of the competition (and thus capture enough of the value it creates for customers), it must engage in activities that  materially increase cash flow. It can do this by increasing the price the company can charge without bleeding volume, by reducing the costs necessary to serve the business without compromising product quality, or by being able to take market share without expending excess capital that would depress returns. Put simply, it has to engage in activities that are both value added and hard to imitate.

To achieve this source of durable excess cash return, new entrants generally have to change the competitive dynamics of an industry in some dramatic fashion (or create a new one) - incumbents have their own sources of competitive advantage that prevents a new entrant from just blatantly copying their success. Malay Gandhi, who a while ago [wrote](https://medium.com/@malay/building-a-big-health-tech-company-76f51ab4da64) the defining piece on building a venture scale healthcare company, put it pretty succintly on a recent podcast. It's very easy to see that a company using software tools can run a more efficient version of an existing insurer or provider. But the key to any new entrant in healthcare's success will be its ability to grow and gain market share. They have to have a scalable distribution advantage. 

So is Oscar a company that's going to truly revolutionize the healthcare industry by changing the rules of competition in the health insurance industry, thereby creating a durable moat for itself? Or is it just another small insurer doomed to be eternally subscale and thus at the mercy of industry economics? 

The report provides some hints as to the answer. Specifically it paints a 'best case' scenario - what Oscar might achieve should its vision come to fruition. And although one has to read between the lines of the report (it is a marketing report after all) a bit to get at that truth, if you do,it's pretty clear what investors saw.

Briefly, Oscar's strategy can be decomposed into 5 parts:

1. Get members to engage with the health insurer regarding their health problesm.
2. Build a virtual care platform that interacts with patients as well as all the interal teams of the company. This platform should include care routing teams, PCPs, messaging, ability to view health records, etc. Several of these tools have been built, several haven't yet.
3. Use the virtual care platform to become a **switch** for routing patients into high-value care episodes. This also involves understanding what physician networks are high value and which are not - especially taking into account referral patterns.
4. Construct tools that allow for a scalable way of ranking and designing physician networks in any geography.
5. Automate many of the back-office tasks of the insurer (what I think is the least important part of the strategy). 

Oscar's report goes into way more detail about these tools and gives data to support their usage rates. But what's lacking from the report directly is an understanding of why those tools are valuable from a competitive dynamics situation. That's what I'll discuss now. 

## Can Oscar Execute a Dominant Strategy?

Specifically, I think that the tools described in Parts 1-4 of that strategy will allows Oscar to engage in a type of competition that former Intel-CEO Andy Grove called 'rule-breaking behavior'. Most of the time, in steady state competitive environments, share shifts between companies are marginal and each competitor attends to a strategy that is defined by the competitive rules of the industry. This is what we traditionally think of when we say that 'strategy is about tradeoffs '. Ben Thompson [states](https://stratechery.com/2013/amazons-dominant-strategy/): "Usually, strategy is about tradeoffs. Do you want to have high quality, or low prices? Do you want to iterate quickly, or create the big launch? Do you want to segment the market and deliver multiple offerings, or focus on one product and gain returns to scale?" What investors saw in Oscar was the ability to break the competitive rules of the game.

In insurance there's a tradeoff between two competitive metrics: **annual member premiums charged** (as well as other costs like deductibles) and the **network's breadth** (the number of provider groups in the network). Cheaper plans tend to be very restrictive, narrow-network plans (e.g. HMOs, EPOs) while more expensive plans tend to be much broader. This reflects the existing competitive reality - if you can reasonably threaten to exclude a provider from a network that drives a lot of their volume (remember, scale is the key path to competitive advantage), then a reasonable price concession will be made by providers to preserve that volume.  

However,  Oscar's new products could enable Oscar to radically change these competitive realities and achieve the best of both worlds: charge premium prices (as if they had a broad network), but operate with a cost advantage because the network will be much less expensive to construct due to its inherent narrowness. In this situation, they maintain competitive advantage as compared to current low-cost, bare-bones products by being able to charge higher prices due to their value added services, while they maintain an advatange vs. higher-cost, more expansive products by operating with lower costs.  And for Oscar, if they are able to execute this strategy, the benefits continue to accrue as they scale. If they are able to charge a differential margin due to the increased value of their internal products, their customer acquisition costs should be lower than industry average and churn should substantially lower than the industry average. In this situation, acquiring and keeping customers is easier for Oscar than for competitors, which will allow them to scale in new markets and continually lower cost of their network, benefitting from the same scale effects that incumbents currently do. Combining economies of scale that improve gross margin while also enabling top-line revenue growth is a dominant strategy indeed. 


Dominant strategies that radically change industry economics as describde above are very, very difficult to execute properly. So to explain why I think Oscar has a good change to be able to pull this off, I have to **identify the sources of this differential margin ** and demonstrate that, to paraphrase great buinsess strategist David Teece, whether Oscar can create a **tight appropriability regime** around those elements of the product that can form the basis for a moat (other competitors shouldn't be able to imitate the new 'internal' products easily). 

I have identified 2 sources of this differential margin: 

1. **Care Routing and Concierge Services, often through Virtual Delivery.** 

2. **High Performance Network Construction Tools.**

 
### Care Routing and Concierge Services

Concierge care is not a new idea. In person, there are some physicians that charge up to $40,000 per year for concierge services. New 'brick and mortar' DPC services have arisen to try and implement the principle, embodied in companies like Qliance, Forward, ChenMed, Iora, etc. The previously mentioned company Better created a virtual nurse for concierge/advice purposes, and companies like Sherpaa Health exist as virtual PCPs that can both offer advice about where/when to seek care. 

But Oscar is thus far one of the only insurers that has directly built and developed a virtual PCP-concierge service as part of its insurance offering. The idea is to get individuals to avoiding using healthcare services for low-acuity conditions and to have them seek out Oscar's own physcians for advice on where to begin care for longer episode. While most insurers have caught on to the trend and contract with telemedicine operators - usually TelaDoc - to provide this service for its members,  most legacy providers can't do much actual care delivery virtually. They can't order labs, order prescriptions, or refer, solely through the telemedicine platform, and so the reccomendation they pretty much always have is to see a physician in person (how useful!). Due to these limitations Oscar actually built its own system to allows its PCPs to review charts, prescribe, order tests, and refer - all through its application. And according to the company, compared to the pitiful utilization rates for telemdicine services amongst incumbents (~3%), around 20% of Oscar's members originate their care inquiries with Oscar telemedicine services. The next step is to move a substantial amount of these virtual visits to a messaging based platform, as opposed to a video based one, thereby reducing the friction in uptake and accelerating utilization even more. 

Taken to its logical extreme, telemedicine (whether messsage-based or video based) with effectitve prescribing, lab-ordering, and referral capabilities becomes **a convinient, quick switch** for effective care routing, ensuring that members:
1. Only get care when they really need it, immediately reducing low-value  utilization.
2. Are aware of and seek out high-value networks of physicians. That is, they see providers who are high-value and who refer to high-value providers. 

There are key advantages to care routing as described above:

1. It adds substantial value to the insurance product offering (thus enabling higher prices) in the form of convinience and lack of hassle. With virtual conversations that can handle a broad variety of health inquiries, there are fewer delays in getting quick answers to health questions and meaningful engagement from actual physicians when serious intervnentions are necessary. That level of convinience and access to physicians is unheard of in the industry today, where wait-times for PCP visits can be over 50 days in some supply constrained regions. 
2. It immediately improves gross margins by reducing low value care utilization either by eliminating it entirely, or ensuring that patients are beginning care in high-value, low-cost referral networks This lowers the dollar amount of claims paid out).
3. Lastly, broad utilization of software-based care routing also implies a radically different level of **trust** in an insurer to make explicit care recommendations. That level of trust is **only** possible with Oscar's product - they just don't exist at incumbent insurers. Think about it - would you call your insurer to tell you where to find care now? I wouldn't. This trust and belief that most care engagement should begin with your insurance company is powerful because it drastically increases the leverage that Oscar has both over its suppliers  as well as customers. In this situation it's Oscar that at least partially owns the customer relationship, not the provider.  Insurance companies' ability to modulate care seeking activities have traditionally been mediated through the blunt tools of benefit design. They don't really interact with customers in a way that could be defined as a traditional customer relationship. Oscar will. 



Everything I discussed above describes the differential margin achievable with broad trust in and thus utilization of insurer-provided virtual care routing products. But remember, in addition to creating a differential margin, this product must impose barriers to imitation from competitors. Can others 
1. Trust imposes natural switching costs.
2. Existing insurance companies don't generally have the capabilities to run robust customer engagement programs necessary to spur the necessary utlization of these services.
3. It's unclear whether incumbents have the capabilities to build consumer facing software with these capabilities. It's possible that success 
4. Indirect demand-side scale in virtual care utilization (not absolute scale). The more individuals actively using Oscar's primary care services as an entry point to the healthcare system, the greater the value of being in Oscar's network to providers. This is essentially the same scale advantage incumbent's leverage, but much more potent in nature, since the trust implied by high utilization of the care routing product is a more precise, high-fidelity way of steering patients, compared to the blunt methods used by insurers today.  



As a note, it's also worth taking a step back and think about how contrarian this bet on bundled primary care and care routing actually is. Most digital health 


### Digitizing Offline Physician Relationships with Medical Graphs 

In the last section I mentioned that one of the benefits of care routing is that it has the potential to serve as a recommendation engine to make sure individuals are entering high value physician networks. This is only possible if Oscar can identify networks of high-value physicians to make those recommendations!






Essentially, Oscar is using the insurance business model to guarantee revenue streams from its actual products: digital health tools that solve specific consumer pain points. It's a neat trick because many of these digital health point solutions have struggled to find sustainable business models independently. Take Better (funded by Social Capital) for example. It's product was universally loved, and so it's not the case that consumers didn't value the product. Rather, in a world where we've conditioned U.S. consumers to pay only for insurance, the work it took to convince customers to pay outside of their traditional channel quickly outran the company's cash balances.
