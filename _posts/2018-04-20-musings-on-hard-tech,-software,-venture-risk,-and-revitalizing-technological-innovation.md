I want to start this blog post with an apology. Unlike most blog posts, which are tightly coupled to a specific topic or theme, this one will be markedly less so. That's because, unlike most blog posts, which are written for me to communicate a specific idea I already have formed to others, this blog post was written to explicilty provide a canvas for thinking about my answers to host of interrelated and important questions. I apologize for this explicit disorganization, but throughout the piece I'll hope to explain why think the questions I'm attempting to answer are important to think about.

The origins of this post start with a job offer. This summer, as a result of some meandering, cold emailing, and, most importantly, the generosity of Adam Gouldburn and Zavain Dar at Lux , I am going to be starting a position as a remote summer associate at Lux Capital. Lux is a firm famous for their relentless focus on so-called 'deep-tech' or 'frontier-tech' investing. Aas part of preparing to join them this summer, as well as part of my own interest in the practice of 'deep-technology' investing, I've attempted to explore the area more deeply, and in doing so, have come across a few key questions and controversial areas that I'd like clarify and disseminate my thoughts on. This post is an attempt to do just that. 

## An Introduction to Deep Technology Investing

There are a lot of definitions for 'deep-tech', 'frontier-tech', and/or 'hard-tech' investing floating around there. Some of them include:

- Investing in companies that develop products incorporating some 'non-software' element (e.g. semiconductors, robotics, cars, rockets/satelittes, biotech - all are included). 
- Investing in computer hardware companies (e.g. new types of systems on a chip, MEMS, storage, peripherals, handsets/devices, etc.)
- Investing in companies attempting to build the next generation of fundamental computing 'platforms', e.g. VR/AR hardware and software, AI infrastructure and applications, etc. 
- Companies operating in the world of 'atoms', as opposed to 'bits.
- Companies sellling to "important" markets related to energy generation and storage, agricultural productivity, sustainability, transporatation, housing, healthcare, etc. 

I think all the definitions are to a certain extent accurate descriptions of the investments of the best so-called 'deep-tech' investors, and I won't try to burden this discussion with a formal definition quite yet (don't worry, I'll get there eventually!).

I'm not sure that I can really paint an accurate picture of deep-tech investing's history, but according to anecdotal accounts, interest in the area is a rather recent phenomenon (at least in its current iteration). The investment area went rather unnoticed for a while as the venture capital world was busy building out the desktop web followed by mobile and cloud platforms and their core 'killer applications'. But it's started to garner interest in recent years, probably because a general feeling, that weâ€™re at the [end of the current cycle of innovation](http://mattturck.com/frontiertech/), has set in amongst many in the venture community. This [may or may not be true](https://news.greylock.com/the-next-great-platform-is-the-one-that-we-already-have-9c33a1236c37) - and I'll talk about that in this post, but the anecdotal examples of a broader interest in deep-tech are abundant. Consider that Lux, which was founded all the way back in 2000, started to get way more attention from the broader VC community recently and, [according to one of their own partners](https://medium.com/bz-notes/remembering-2017-and-wishing-startups-a-successful-2018-316992ae9844), was joined by a host of new competition in the area. Sequoia and other venture stalwarts started turning their eyes (and their investing muscle) back to making hardware and health-tech/biotech/med-tech investments (although it should be noted that they have always funded computer hardware and  healthcare companies; it's merely a question of the frequency of, and attention given to, those fundings). Additionally, novel types of companies built outside the dominant computing value chains, like Tesla, SpaceX, Nest, etc., started to capture not just the attention of financiers for their successes, but the imaginations of the public as well. And as a sure sign of changing times, Y Combinator, best known as a software accelerator, upped it's committments to companies founded around other types of technological discontinuities; they started investing in more complex, albeit still software-driven investments (e.g Cruise) before deciding to make even larger committments to funding different types of companies, from biotechs to satellites. 

I admit that it is this very explosion of interest in deep-technology that garnered my interest in the area. I doubt that, as an undergraduate student just starting to explore the waters of the venture industry, I'd have found my way to Lux without the surge of interest pushing stories into my purview. 

Now, along with the sense of awe that came along with this increasing interest in deep-tech (e.g., 'holy shit, did you _see_ the Space X simultaneous rocket landing....'), a host of questions arose, both from the broader public, as well as enterpreneurial and venture community about the dangers of such a shift.  All one has to do to gauge the degree of unease is read Elad Gil's ['End of Cycle' piece](http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/07/end-of-cycle.html), and hunt for some quotes in the recent [New Yorker piece](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny) on Sam Altman. 

Their criticism isn't unwarranted. So much so that Lux Partner Shahin Farshchi, a stalwart deep-tech investor, just published an article [_today_](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/28/investing-in-frontier-technology-is-and-isnt-cleantech-all-over-again/) which discussed the comparisons between current frontier-tech investing and the clean-tech boom of the mid-2000s, which ended quite badly for investors. 


The canonical history of the venture capital industry places its beginnings in the late-1940s with George Doriot's founding of ARDC and subsequent funding of Digital Equipment Corporation. The canonical history of the 'technology' industry  on the other hand places its beginnings somwhere between the creation of IBM and its tabulating machines at the turn of the century, Turing's famous paper on the  _Entscheidungsproblem_,  and the birth of Fairchild Semiconductor in the 1950s. However, I think those definitions are overly restrcitive. They both posit the 'technology' as synonymous with the fruit that has been borne out of the seemingly inexorable rise of computing in the latter half of the twentieth century. But in reality, technology, and the job of commercializing it, have a much broader history. 

In fact, I think that anybody who really wants to understand the  fundamental nature of technical innovation and its relation to  the formation of new businesses has to expand their study to include the time period from 1850 - 1925. 

My thinking on this topic has really been shaped by three books, _Creating the Twentieth Century_ and _Transforming the Twentieth Century_ by Valcav Smil, as well as _Engines that Move Markets_ by Alasdair Nairn (hard to find), each of which partly chronicles the rapid invention and commercialization of a set of radically discontinuous and foundational set of products during the brief latter half of the 19th and early 20th century. It was in this time that modernity as we've come to understand it was built. 

We're all pretty familiar with even a rudimentary list of the the products brought to market in this time period. They include: telephones, sound recordings, permanent dynamos, chemical pulp,  reinforced concrete, affordable electric lights, electricity-generating plants, electric motors and trains, transformers, steam turbines, the process of crude oil refining, the gramophone, popular photography, practical gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines, motorcycles, automobiles, aluminum production, crude oil tankers, air-filled rubber tires, steel- skeleton skyscrapers, prestressed concrete, diesel engines, x-rays, movies, air liquefaction, the first wireless signals, mass-produced cars, the first airplanes, tractors, radio broadcasts, vacuum tubes, tungsten light bulbs, neon lights, common use of halftones in printing, stainless steel, hydrogenation of fats, air conditioning, a host of electric-motor powered home appliances (e.g. fridges), and the Haber-Bosch synthesis of ammonia. 

When you analyze the history of these products, a couple of key lessons stand out:

1.**Every industry sector or product category we consider 'boring' today - think utilities, specialty and commodity chemicals, home appliances, etc. - were once high growth, 'exciting', opportunities.**  Of course, we don't consider any of those sectors as fast growing anymore. We don't even really call them 'technology'. But in their time, these product categories  were exemplars of radical technical innovation. That is, they were the 'tech' products of their age. Correspondingly, the companies that commercialized those core products were the fastest growing, most lucrative investments around (even if the investors were not professionalized into a class we would recognize as 'venture capital')  - much like software startups are today. The cities that hosted these developers of technical innovation became hotbeds for supporting complementary innovations - much like Silicon Valley has for the broader computing industry. This, to me, implies that while there _are_ important differences between investing in software today and what would have been investing in many of these products above one hundred years ago, in reality what made software (and computing more broadly) the epicenter of the technology and venture capital world for the last 20 years was simply its place as the novel, innovative technological frontier and thus the area where growth was possible. Investors hence flocked to the sector. The second key takeaway here is that - even though computing and, more recently, software has defined the industry in which growth has occurred,  we shouldn't assume that it's the _only_ form factor for commercial scale technologies. Each invention above was radical, built in the world of atoms, and was rapidly commercialized and improved after invention. 
2. I also think that even when we do realize the highly technical nature of past innovations, what we  we seem to forget is that many of these products build the foundations of durable and long lasting businesses as well. We tend to believe that older companies 

What does this all have to do with deep-tech? 



## Topic 3: Where will growth come from; computing or elsewhere? 


Ultimately, VCs, deep-tech or otherwise, are interested in understanding where _change_ is going to come from. Donald Valentine once said, " See, venture capital is very reducible to a few words. You have to be interested in **managing change**, and you have to recognize that change is _necessary_". Of course, musings on the future of technological innovation is not stricly a part of our day job, and it would be a  misnomer to believe that VCs can proactively predict or shape the directions of technological change (even the most 'thesis-driven' investors are somewhat reactive). But, this inability to actually shape these trends also provides VCs an advantage in attempting to forecast them: we also have the right distance from the issue to attempt to answer it objectively and without certain types of bias.

The first subquestion that one must answer before attempting forecast where growth comes from will be to understand how to _identify_ growth when it occurs. The biggest way I see is to try and understand what individuals from the past would find strange or otherwise mind-blowing if they were brought from their time to the present. Unforunately, if you brought someone from say, 1920, to the present, there is much they _would_ recognize.  This lack of change in a set of domains of life is partly what deep-tech investors (see the previous topic) are attempting to change by being willing to broaden their understanding of what consistutes technology and be willing, to paraphrase Lux Managing Partner Josh Wolfe, to invest not just in the innovations spun from the computer science department, but from the chemistry, biology, and physics departments too. 





## Topic 3: What about Software? Should Silicon Valley Stick to Software? Is Software Special?

Now that some of my thoughts about the general technology industry are laid down, the elephant in the room has to be addressed. How does the future of computing play into the visions 



## Topic 4: The False Dichotomy Between 'Software' and 'Hard-Tech' Investing.

As indicated by Topic 3, for a while now (according to Marc Andreesseen, at least since the Internet Bubble in 2000) 

## Topic 5: Risk and Models of Successful New Company Entrance. 
## Topic 6: Thinking About Capital Intensity in Deep-Tech Companies.



I think all the definitions are to a certain extent accurate descriptions of the investing processes of the best so-called 'deep-tech' investors. But none of them are based in the principles underpinning successful new company formation. My definition, which attempts to take these factors into account, is as follows:

> **A deep technology company is one that is attempting to commercialize a product that is only made possible due to a order-   of-magnitude change in technological capabilities, a change that is driven (and developed) by the company in question. Additionally, the change in technological capabilities is closely related to the companies ability to create value for customers and build defensibility.**


I think this definition is broad enough
