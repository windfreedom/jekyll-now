Entrepreneurs, justifiably, think a lot about tactics, culture and execution. 

They try to answer questions like:

- What product features should we build? 
- What business model should we use? 
- How do we price the product? 
- How do I hire my first sales people? 
- What is the message I want to be repeating to my employees. 

These are tactical questions, and ones that, if not executed upon, spell certain death for a young company. 

Strategy on the other hand, is considered an antique of a slower moving business environment. It’s top-down, unresponsive to fast-changing conditions on the ground,  and delivered by suits from McKinsey, Bain, or BCG charging millions in consulting fees. And thus, it’s found in the realms in big companies of the “old” economy, like Ford and McDonald’s, not the nimble startups of a world in which software eats everything. Even at their most optimistic, strategy seems to be seen as something to consider when a company is at a later stage and the competitive dynamics between a company and its competitors are more well defined. 

Partly because of this belief, much of the advice that’s given to entrepreneurs, from VCs, as well as in the popular entrepreneurial discourse, is tactical in nature. 

But to discard strategy as a relic of a bygone era is dangerous for entrepreneurs. Strategy is critically important for any company, startups included. 

What is straetgy? 

Defined by Andy Grove, strategy simply is the question of  **“how a company can gain, sustain, and/or regain profitable growth in its environment”**. 

Strategy for entrepreneurs then, is fundamentally a discipline that explains how their small companies can grow to become big, dominant ones, which if you believe [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html), is the fundamental characteristic of a startup in the first place. Strategy tried to describe the deep drivers of company success, startups included. 

And in fact, contrary to the belief that strategy is a discipline for big companies in established product categories, startups actually have more degrees of freedom to work with with respect to their strategy than big companies do. Startups are not burdened by legacy product lines, and old choices. If strategy is the art of choosing a route on a map, a startup’s map is blank. 

In that sense, there’s arguably nothing as important as strategy to a young startup. 

So if we’ve accepted (and I’ll assume you have too if you’re still reading) that strategy is important for entrepreneurs to grasp, the logical next question is, “what should entrepreneurs know about it?”

Let’s start with the basics. 

For the purposes of this post, I will be defining ‘startups’ more broadly than you might think. My definitions is,  **“a company attempting to sell a new solution category in a market that is had not previously operated in”**. 

Note here that the unit of analysis is NOT limited to VC-backed startups, but rather any company, big or small, funded through any mechanism (retained earnings, debt, equity, etc.) that is attempting to sell a new solution to a customer’s problems. I’m also limiting myself to discussing companies that are attempting to go from “zero to one”, from zero customers to building a big business around a single solution category. Although I will touch on multi-business strategy at the end of the piece, I’m not going to include situations like big businesses going international with their products. I’m going to stay laser focused on startups. 

Also, note my use of the word “solution category”. The reason I chose that verbiage instead of say, “new product”, is to be deliberately agnostic as to how a new startup tries to solve a problem in a new, better way. It could be because they came up with a new product category which solves a problem in a better way, like General Electric did when they displaced gas lighting with electric lighting. But it also could be because the startup used a different business model that added value to the customer, like Compaq’s “Direct Sales” model did to HP. The point is that ultimately, the correct way to view a startup is as a company offering a solution to a problem and thus the correct unit of analysis for an entrepreneurial strategy piece is the solution offered. 

Our strategy story begins with a universal truth. 

The value of a company is the present value of its future free cash flows discounted to the present at an appropriate rate. That is a fundamental facet of corporate valuation. Dominant companies then, are valued highly because investors believe that these companies will throw off a lot of cash flow in the future and do it for a long time (the cash flows will be persistent), even if they are not doing so now.  

Under a set of simplifying assumptions (namely a steady-state equilibirum), you can break down the free cash flow stream of a business during a period of equilibrium into the following components. 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=value&space;=&space;n&space;\cdot&space;g\cdot&space;m\cdot&space;s" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?value&space;=&space;n&space;\cdot&space;g\cdot&space;m\cdot&space;s" title="value = n \cdot g\cdot m\cdot s" /></a>

where:
- _n_ represents the number of customers with a problem that a solution category solves. 
- _g_ represents the terminal growth rate of the number of those customers. 
- _m_ represents the margin per customer (ARPU - Cost of Serving That Customer including fixed costs and variable costs)
- _s_ represents market share. 

From this formula, 3 fundamental drivers of a company’s value drop out: **nature of market**, **unit economics**, and **competition**. 

Let’s start with the first - markets. 

## What is a market? 

The word market gets thrown around in business discourse a lot, particularly in the world of startups ever since Don Valentine stated that VCs should "Invest in Big Markets".  But we're often vague about our definition of markets. So let's nail a definition down.  

According to marketing guru Geoffrey Moore, a market is “a set of **actual or potential** customers for a set of products/services, that have a **common set of problems, needs or wants**”. 

I’ve highlighted the two most important aspects of this definition that I will focus on. Namely, I will be making 2 points. 

1. Markets are defined by existing or new problems, needs, or wants. 
2. Markets consist of both actual and potential customers. 

### Markets are Defined by Problems, Needs, or Wants

The second of these aspects is the most intuitive. Markets - at least in the way I will define them - are defined by problems, needs, and wants. Customers use a product because it solves a problem they have, or because it meets a need or want. So instead of defining a market by product category (e.g. "a $100M market for automobiles), I will define markets by dollars spent to solve a particular problem. I do this both to be consistent but also because it more readily reveals all the possible solution categories we turn to in order to solve a given problem.  

Additionally, what may feel new about this definition is that there is a difference between problems/needs/wants that exist or are new. 

Most of the time, customers are well aware of the problems, needs, and wants they have and are attempting to meet them with whatever solutions are currently available. When customers are aware of both the problems they have and the solution categories available to them, I call those problems  “existing problems”.  

Other times however, truly new problems, needs, or wants, can emerge. Many times, this is due to an adjacent new product gaining traction. For example, the problem that computers on different LANs couldn’t exchange information with each other (solved by Cisco’s first multi-protocol router) was a problem that wouldn’t have existed prior to the mid-1980s. Only the growth of another product category - Local Area Networks and the Workstation - created the problem that multi protocol routers actually ended up solving. But it can also be for a variety of other reasons, macroeconomic forces, etc. 

Additionally, sometimes products are so revolutionary in nature as to unearth a “hidden” or latent want/need in the customer, thereby in a sense creating a market from scratch. It’s rare, but as Marc Andreessen described in a blog [here](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html), it has occasionally happened, like with VMWare and OS Virtualization.  

In all these cases, it’s clear that new problems, needs, or wants, can spontaneously or be induced to emerge. The key question to determine whether a proble is new or already exist is simple: _“Are customers aware of this problem need, or want?”_

### Markets Comprise Actual and Potential Customers with a Problem, Need, or Want. 

The first aspect of my definition of markets, that they comprise of both actual and potential customers, is actually less intuitive than you might think. But it’s something that any reader of Clayton Christensen should recognize: sometimes there are people who would love to use a solution category to solve a problem or meet a need, but simply can’t. 

Sometimes this is because it’s too expensive, other times because the technology embedded in the project makes it impractical to use. 

Because of this, new solution categories that solve problems can _expand the market_ by allowing a host of individuals who wouldn’t have been able to solve a problem, actually do so using a new solution category. For examples, see: Personal Computers, SpaceX’s rockets, etc. Even smartphones, which started off really epxpensive, got cheaper and better, to the point where now, they have "converted" potential customers into "actual ones". In fact, this type of market expansion due to the emergence of new product categories is so prevalent in the history of technological innovation that Ben Evans, a prominent a16z blogger and technology strategist, wrote an entire [post](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/2/28/market-size)  devoted to the topic. This propensity for technology to create innovations that expand markets by allowing a host of individuals to solve problems they weren't able to solve before is at the heart of the "democratizing" element of technology. 

## A Typology of Startup Markets

Using these two dimensions, we can chart a typology of different types of markets a startup can choose to enter.

![Typology of Markets](https://github.com/windfreedom/windfreedom.github.io/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-07-29%20at%202.19.21%20PM.png)

￼
1. A startup can choose to sell a new solution category to a set of existing customers. These customers know their problems, and use existing solution categories in so far as they exist. A startup’s job then is to solve their problems in a way that’s so much better than existing solutions (10x is the vague improvement level that VCs tend to like) that it “shifts spend” from existing solutions to their own. 
2. A startup can choose to sell a new solution category to a set of potential customers. These customers are also aware of their problems or wants, but cannot use existing solution categories for some reason. In this sense, a startup must solve a problem for a new set of customers who otherwise were not consuming, create spend by moving individuals from “non consumption” to “consumption”. 
3. A startup can choose to sell a new solution category to meet a truly new problem, need or want or one that is so revolutoinary as to unearth latent wants in the customer base. These customers are usually only newly becoming aware of a problem or want and thus again, a startup's job is to create spend. 

In this sense, both **Market Type #2 and Market Type #3 describe “new markets”**, whereas **Market Type #1 describes “existing markets”**. 

There are a couple of things to note about this typology. 

Firstly, note that while the typology is completely exhaustive - all markets should fall into one of these three categories - it’s _not mutually exclusive_. Startups selling new product categories sometime address multiple markets, some existing, some new. 

This is a critical point and so I want to state it again. **New solution categories should not fall into one category alone.**
This is part of the point Ben Evans tries to make in the post I linked to above. The total market for a given solution category is defined by the total amount of dollars that will be spent on using it to solve every one of the problems it can possibly solve. And  this market can therefore can expand for 2 reasons as the price-performance trajectory improves (it's form factor gets smaller, it's price decreases, it's speed improves, etc.). 

1. As the price-performance trajectory of a solution category improves, it can expand the market by converting "potential customers" into "actual customers" - often because the technology gets cheaper - or by pulling customers out ('from below') from the old solution categories into the new one - because a solution category gets better. 
2. As price-performance trajectories improve, a solution category reach a threshold where it's better than existing solutions to _entirely  new problems_ that it couldn't have solved properly before certain thresholds were met.

This chart tries to illustrate the relationships between different markets as a solution category evolves. 

![Evolving Market Dynamics](/Screen Shot 2018-07-29 at 2.19.21 PM.png)

In both these ways, the boundaries of a "market" for new solution categories is highly dynamic.  All of the most transformative products, from the automobile, to instant-photography, to the smartphone, exhibit this phenomenon, each taking its own path. The PC for example, started out as a worse-but-good-enough solution that allowed people who couldn't use existing minicomputers to access computing. But as it became cheaper and better, it began to meet new needs (e.g. spreadhseets, gaming, etc.), expand the market, **and** pull customers who would have been using minicomputers into its fold (classic "new market" disruption). And that was before the advent of the browser! Thus, the the borders of the "PC Market" changed over time.  So when considering what a market for a solution category is, one must think about the size of all of the problems the solution category can solve now **and** all of the problems it can solve as the price-performance trajectory improves until it begins to flatline (if it is going to improve).


Secondly, the composition of markets that a new solution category can address matters for strategic reasons as well. 

The first-order reason why the choice matters is simply because the number of customers and growth rate of the number of customers in each type of market can clearly be different. And as Don Valentine loves to state, targeting big markets is important. A startup has to be targeting a market that at the very least has or will have a lot of customers in it if it’s going to ever spin off tons of cash. It’s a “necessary but not sufficient” condition. 

But also, a new solution category being sold by a startup may have different value to different types of customers, and thus the maximum potential price it can charge will also be different for each type of market. Again, this price, with its direct link to revenue, is an important part of the maxim “target big markets” - you want markets with either a lot of customers, customers who are willing to pay a lot, or both. 

And lastly, the choice of market matters because it in of itself determines a part of another second large driver of free cash flow - and the one I will be talking the most about: the competition a new business will face.


### An Example: The Case of the Telegraph 

Let's look at an example of all the ideas I've talked about thus far to bring the concepts into reality. The example I've chosen is that of the telegraph and its dominating company, Western Union. 



## There are Fundamentally Different Types of Competition

Competition might be the lifeblood of capitalism. But from the perspective of a business owner, it sucks. It eats at your margins and market share. And left unchecked, it can ensure that all the value created by a product or service goes straight to the customer, without any left for the producer.

But what doesn’t get discussed about competition is that not all competition is the same. Competing with Microsoft in the 1990s was and would be very different than competing with a small number of startups. But it’s not just size of competitors that matters.  There are fundamentally different types of competition and competitors. 

I identify 3 types of competitors that a startup will have to consciously think about during it’s lifecycle. 

The first of course, are **direct competitors**. These are companies - often other startups - that are attempting to sell the same solution category that you are also attempting to sell. They might choose different tactics: initially target different markets, choose different product features, or sometimes even adopt a different business model. But they are selling the same solution to a similar set of problems, needs, or wants. This type of competition is what we usually think about and worry about the most. And what we’ll see later on is that while most strategy literature is dedicated to mastering this type of competition, it’s the last type of competition that a startup will have to worry about. 

The second type of competitors are  **indirect competitors**. This is the first of the 2 types of “incumbents” a startup may have the displeasure of having to deal with. Indirect competitors  are companies that sell existing solutions to a set of problems. They are the companies selling the products yours is trying to displace from the marketplace. The Blockbuster’s to your Netflix. Hotels to your AirBnB. To them, you are just a pesky substitute. And note that while I call them “incumbents”, they don’t have to be large, scaled, dominant companies. Taxi cab operators were the ‘indirect competitors’ that Uber displaced. 

When Joseph Schumpeter, venture's favorite economist, speaks of competition as, “an incessant sweeping out of old products, processes, and organizational forms, by new ones”, this is the type of competition he’s discussing - the quest for startups to displace indirect competitors. 

The most important things to note about these indirect competitors is that A. They are a pain to displace (for reasons we will discuss later) but that  B. You can avoid them! If your solution targets a truly new market (as defined in the previous section), then there really aren’t any indirect competitors, either because the problem/need/want itself is new, or because you’re targeting a set of customers that is not served by those incumbents (a set of “potential customers”).

Note: In the case where a problem is so vexing as to have no solutions at all, and your startups’ is the first then you fall in the latter camp. But it’s easy to _think_ this, and have it not be true, which is why it doesn't get much airtime with me. 

The last type of competitor a startup might have to deal with is an **adjacent competitor**. An adjacent competitor is usually a large company that operates in an adjacent industry or market segment and therefore has the functional capability to build the same solution category the startup is building and thus enter the market to become a direct competitor. In this sense, they are potential direct competitors. When people refer to the a startups “ability to compete with Google” or when people did worry about a startup’s ability to “compete with Microsoft” back in the late 1980s, they were worrying about adjacent competition. Handling adjacent competition is not actually about outcompeting anyone in a marketplace. It's about figuring out how to delay the time at which adjacent competitors enter the market and become direct competitors. They will eventually enter if you're successful, but it must be when a startup is ready for it.  For a very modern example of the power of potential competition from adjacent competitors, take Tesla. When individuals worry about Tesla’s ability to compete with other automakers, they’re worried about both indirect competition (“will Tesla’s EV product category be able to substantially replace ICE vehicles?”) and adjacent competition (“will other automakers be able to build EVs that blow Tesla out of the water if they so choose?”)

Let’s make things a bit more visceral with some well understood examples. Let’s take Uber. Uber - leaving aside its push into autonomous vehicles - is simultaneously competing against Lyft and other ride-hailing services as direct competitors and taxis (an indirect competitor that it has already mostly displaced), and  even scooters  as indirect competitors (an indirect competitor that the company is attempting to turn into an asset via equity investments and potentially acquisitions).

## Why Competition Matters Most

I will be spending most of my time discussing competition and how startups interact with competition. The reason for this focus, at the expense of the other 2 drivers of business value which I identified -  unit economics and market choice - is because a businesses ability to handle each of the three forces of competition I’ve outlined is **the most fundamental determinant of business success**. 

Product-market fit, positive unit economics and a large potential market - they are not sufficient to ensure durable business success. Don’t get me wrong - they are necessary and thus extremely important. 

Product-Market fit ensures that the “dogs want to eat the dog food”. It ensures that value creation is occurring for your customers, which is a prerequisite to value creation for the business itself (the value created for the customer is a "ceiling" from which you can capture value), and gives you a hint as to how valuable your solution is. 

Analyzing your unit economics helps you understand - in the best case - how much cash you’re going to be able to take out of the business, how much capital you will have to raise and when, etc. 

And of course your choice of market will help answer the question “how high is up?” How valuable could this company in the best case? 


Each of these elements forms the substrate for your business - the foundation that you’re going to try to build a dominant business on top of.  Without a strong foundation, it’s going to be very hard to build a great business. But a strong foundation is only the start. These elements give you _profit potential, not profits themselves_. Profits themselves (on a cash basis of course) are dependent on a business’s ability to handle the arbitraging forces of competition. 

Take Intel as an example. It built a huge franchise in microprocessors, but only  after failing to do so in their memory chips - their original product line! But memory chips had a great foundation for a valuable business. It had product market fit, better initial unit economics  than microprocessors (higher gross margins at first combined with lower consumer acquisition costs) and a huge market - all backed up by the same operational excellence that Intel came to be known for. And yet, Intel was forced to exit that business line completely. The memory chip product line had the correct substrate for a great business. So did the microprocessor business. The only thing that differentiated the microprocessor business from the memory chip business was the ability of Intel to prevent competitors from arbitraging away the profit potential in the business line. 

Therefore, only finding a way to handle each type of competition can ensure that a startup can - assuming there a solution desired by customers (and thus value being created for the customer)  - successfully enter the market, grow cash flows by taking the market, by making sure that a substantial fraction of the value you create for customers is captured. 

Without an ability to displace indirect incumbents where they exist, a startup won’t even have much free cash flow for competitors to try to steal. It’s solution may create value for the few customers it can reach, but it won’t ever take the majority of the market. 

Without an ability to prevent adjacent competitors from entering your market at the same time your are, you will be competing from the very start with a myriad of others trying to build the same solution. And it’s very likely that they will have similar (or even greater) functional capabilities (particularly in distribution, marketing, and sales) and bigger war chests. That doesn’t mean you won’t eventually be able build a successful business, but you will have to build defensibility against these now direct competitors and displace existing solutions at the same time. It’s a lot harder. 

And of course, without an ability to build defensibility against direct competitors, they will arbitrage all the profit potential out of your business,The price will collapse towards the marginal cost and you’ll find yourself in the airline business. 

Handling competition is the sine qua non of building a successful business. So next time, I’m going to teach you the basics of how I think about each type of competition. 



### A Brief Digression on Unit Economics 

You might have noticed that I have not talked about one of the other big drivers of business value - unit economics. 

That’s not because unit economics are not important. They absolutely are. It doesn’t matter how big the market is if your gross margin is awful - just ask community hospitals! Let me explain why I've chosen to focus on competition over unit economics. 

The main reason for my focus is that some of the biggest inputs into the unit economics equation - things like  gross margin and cost of capital expenditures in a  manufacturing businesses or consumer acquisition costs and churn for subscriber businesses - are affected by competition. That is, unit economics are made up of factors both intrinsic to a particular product/service category as well as those that are a function of competition. 

Take ARPU. The higher it is, the better for your company. But the price you can charge is at least partly a function of the amount of competition you face for your product. Or take churn. Churn is partly intrinsic - a result of how good your solution to a customer’s problem actually is. But the more competitors your customer chooses between, the higher your churn will likely be. 

Thus, I will be talking about those aspects of the unit economics equation can are modulated by the effects of competition. But what I won’t be discussing is the drivers of unit economics that are a fundamental part of the product category.
