When most VCs get asked the question: "How do you evaluate investment opportunities?" (or some variation of that question), most have a fairly generic response. Make sure you're in a fast-growing (and eventually, really big) market. Solve a real pain point for your customers ('Vitamins not aspirin'). Have a dynamite team tailored for the job at hand. Make sure the product can be good enough to find product-market fit, if not the be best possible product in the category.  Think about whether the business is defensibile (and therefore can generate good, sometimes great, margins). Etc. Etc. There are often other things discussed too, but you get the point. It's a simple answer.

This answer is just generic enough to be both _right_ - these factors in a company are **very** important and thus universally considered by every investor - and not detailed enough to satiate me. The answer also falls in line with what people want to believe about venture - that it's _simple_ but _difficult_. The idea that you should look at the market, team, product, and  defensibility is a very _simple_ framework for investing, but one that's probably devilishly difficult to get work in practice. And I agree with that sentiment. But still, this answer has never sat well with me - it's always seemed like the "Venture Captial 101" answer, designed to be right but also designed to hide nuances. As someone who wants to be in this industry for the long run, it therefore seemed obvious to me that I should try and go find the "Venture Capital 200" answer and really explore the nuances.

I didn't find one good framework that gave me all the answers - nor should I have expected too. If there was just one 'right' framework with which to analyze technology investing, everyone would build their investment strategies around it and by definition, there would be no outsized returns. However, what I did find was that by reading broadly about the history of technology-driven businesses (beyond just the ICT revolution and back all the way to the 1800s), as well as literature from corporate finance, corporate strategy, business school professors, and economists, I came accross 5-6 core mental models that I would always refer to and modify when I was trying to explain or analyze a startup success or failure. So I thought I would write about those core frameworks and explain some of the modifications I made to them to make them more useful to me.  


## Framework 1: The Basics of Competitive Advantage



## Framework 2: Andy Grove and Strategic Dynamics

Porter's Forces, and all the work that has stemmed from it, provides a great way of analyzing a business at a particular time. In economic parlance it's a great model of competitive statics. Unforuntately, it's not well suited to analyze change. And as venture practitioners, change is what we're interested in. **How is competitive advantage gained by new entrants and lost by incumbents?** **What conditions make gaining and losing competitive advantage possible?** These are the questions upon which a successful  To answer these questions, we turn to one of Silicon Valley's most important operators - Andy Grove. It turns out, in addition to largely inventing the management style of the Valley, using that to build one of the defining companies in technology history, and writing about it, Andy Grove was also a teacher! He and Robert Burgelman (author of _Strategy is Destiny_) co-taught a class at the Stanford GSB in which they attempted to provide a framework to answer those very questions. They also wrote about in a book called _Strategic Dynamics_ which I recommend for anyone interested in a cool look at a manager and strategists outlook on technology themes in the 1980s and 1990s. Because of that I call this framework the Strategic Dynamics framework.

Grove defines strategy as a company's method for creating profitable growth in its environment. Using that definition, Grove defines the entire set of variables one needs to conisder as a set of three elements: **P**, **E** and **e**. **P** is the company of interest while **E** represents it's environment. **P** then can be seen as a vector consisting of the variables an individual company can internally control, while **E** is a vector consisting of market and non-market forces that shape the environment the company operates in. Which ones? The exact same forces Porter (and others) identified above. **E** consists of the traditional five market forces forces - suppliers, customers, substitutes, direct competitors, and new entrants - as well as complementors, distribution channels, and two non-market forces, technology and governemental regulation. So far, it seems that this framework is just the same framework we defined above with some added structure. Not so. Grove also defined a third element of the set: **e**. which represents other industries or emerging segments that have the potentially to affect **E** and thus **P** at some time in the future. e can represent emerging technologies, emerging substitutes, emerging complements, emereging competitors (e.g. a new market), etc. That is, it consists of a vector with the _same_ representative elements as **E**, but in a different context, either another industry or an emerging vector. Together, **(E,e)** represent the entire environment a company must consider when strategizing.

Grove realized that normally, the interactions between any element in **(E,e)** are in steady-state, which can be desribed like this.

Firstly, the current relationship between P and each element in E can be either one of indifference, subordination, or interdependence or dominance, depending P's control over and dependence on E. At any point in time, the sum of these relationships determines whether a firm has competitive advantage. Note that this is not explanatory, merely observational in nature - this tells me nothing about why P is strategically subordinate or dominant, just that it is.   

Secondly, change in these relationships is constant, but the type of change occuring can be radically different. Some change is limited and stable. In this situation of limited change, both actors in the (E,e) as well as P engage in what are known as rule abiding actions, which Grove defines as, "actions that are consistent with the prevalent power relationships among the industry players and with the industry recipe for success". These rules, which can be normative (based on law, culture, ethics, administrative principles), technological (based on the available technology), economic (representing the existing balance of economic power), or cognitive (involving widely shared knowledge about success factors), are the embodiment of statics. When limited change occurs, the relationships between elements in (E,e) and P don't change (i.e. subordinates remain subordinates, dominant firms remain dominants) and thus competitive advantage, when it exists, isn't born or lost. Some change can occur of course, but it doesn't meaningfully change the distribution of potential industry earnings (PIE), nor can it create or destroy entire industries. Think of recent interactions between Boeing and Airbus, two aerospace manufacturerers. Airbus made a strategic error in comitting resources to the A380 product, which incorrectly identified larger planes as a desire of the customer base (largely because Boeing's faux committments to upgrading the 747-800). The A380 flopped on launch, and Airbus will never recoup the investment it made in developing the product, but the aerospace industry has not materially changed in structure. The manufacturing segment is still characterized by a duopoly. Manufacturers hold more power than airline operators. The basis of Boeing and Airbus' competitive advantage hasn't changed. Boeing just gained a bit at the expense of Airbus.  

More radical types of change - the type of change that we're interested in as venture capitalists - occurs when 10X change in elements of P or E,e (remember, the elements inlcude technology, government regulation, customers, suppliers, etc.) allows for rule-breaking actions to be taken, either by actors in the environment (P-independent change) or by the P-itself (P-controlled change). These actions then materially affect the distribution of potential industry earnings (PIE), either by creating an industry, altering one, or destroying one. Lastly, Grove also noticed that such change - change that allows for rule-breaking actions to be engaged in - rarely derives from E-P interactions, but rather from autonomous initiatives taken by players in e. Most opportunities presented by e are small and not viable - but at times e can grow rapidly to complement or substitute E. Additionally and just as important, the small size of e offers the opportunity for players (either P, or others in E) to explore opportunities for rule-breaking action _outside_ the purview of the existing steady state environment. 

This framework provides a powerful set of guidelines for the ways change can occur, industries can be created, altered by new entrants, or even destroyed:

1. P is the company of interest. E = (Customers, Direct Competitors, Suppliers, Substitutes, Complementors, New Entrants, Technology, Government Regulation, Channels). e is a carbon copy of E except each entry in e represents the same force in adjacent industries or emerging segments. 
2. At any point in time, P either has or does not have a competitive advantage. To test whether a firm does, you must consider two questions. Does the firm have materially higher cash flows than competitors (Benefit)? And are there reasons why only they have acess to that higher cash flow (Barriers)? Benefit is defined by a company's ability (all else equal) to charge higher prices, maintain higher market share, obtain a lower cost structure (higher gross margin, lower acquisition costs, etc.), or invest at a faster rate than it's direct competitors. If a firm can do this, it likely has competitive advantage. Barriers are reasons **why** others cannot achieve those benefits. 
2. This competitive advantage - if it exists - is expressed in the relationships (subordinate, interdependent,cominant, indifferent) between P and each element of (E,e) and in the rules of the interactions (technological, normative, cultural, economics) that elements in E abide by. Linear change is rule abiding and doesn't change relationships in way to materially change PIE or create/destroy industries.
3. However, 10X changes in the elements of (E, e) (Most often, e, e.g. exploring an emerging technology that can create a new product) can allow for rule-breaking actions to be taken, and thus materially alter the relationships between P and (E,e). Thus, competitive advantages can be gained and lost due to 10x changes in elements of e. 
4. The importance of e as a shield from existing competitive situation of E has to be noted. Here's why. What allows for e to engage in rule-breaking actions is the 10x change in some environmental element. But what prevents actors in E (especially incumbent companies) from attempting to enter e is uncertainty stemming from its **size** or **viability**. Let's consider a thought experiment. A new entrant, _N_ approaches an existing environment E, in which competitive advantage is held by a set of firms P<sub>1</sub>, and PP<sub>2</sub>. _N_ has used a 10X change in technology (an member of _e<sub>1</sub>_)to create a product with better performance and cheaper cost structure. It decides to market this product to the existing customer set in E. Because _N_ is launching the product with obviously defined benefits, the signal to P<sub>1</sub> and PP<sub>2</sub> that this change will negatively affect their slice of the PIE is strong.  Unless there is a strong reason why the existing incumbents cannot replicate and market the product, they will do so because the signal is so clear.  However,  by exploring say, an emerging market segment, _e<sub>2</sub>_, whose needs can only be met by the new product, P<sub>1</sub>, and PP<sub>2</sub> will be hesistant to enter the technology seriously because they doubt the size of _e<sub>2</sub>_ will be large. Additionally, they could doubt the technical viability of the product in _e<sub>1</sub>_, which could prevent them from entry. In both cases, _e_ is valuable to those desiring  beacuse of its uncertainty. 10X changes with little uncertainty will change PIE and structure, but not necessarily in a way that's _detrimental_ to P. 
5. 

Note: The use of '10x' is a convention I have taken from Grove and highly depends on the context of the change - some changes that can allow for rule-breaking actions to be taken may not necessarily be a quantitative 10x in magnitude. E.g. it's impossible to say whether a technological change like the Closed Body in automotive manufacturing increased the value of the product by 10x to customers, but it did enough to allow new entrants like Chrysler and GM, which did not have competitive advantage, to gain it!

Grove has a great name for points at which, due to 10X changes in market and non-market forces, often derving from e, put tremendous strain upon a companies relationship between the environment. They're called a **strategic inflection point**.
