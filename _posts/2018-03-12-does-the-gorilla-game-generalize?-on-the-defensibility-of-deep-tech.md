Geoffrey Moore is a legend in the technology industry. His three most famous books: _Crossing the Chasm_, _Inside the Tornado_, and _The Gorilla Game_ are must-reads for anybody interested in the industry, particularly if you're interested in B2B companies.

Much to my own embarassment, I hadn't managed to finish any of the books, even though some of the best VCs of all time - most notably Bill Gurley and Andy Rachleff - highly recommend them. I wanted to rectify this. As Spring Break was fast approaching, I decided to start and finish _The Gorilla Game_.

_The Gorilla Game_ does a great job of giving a high-level overview of the strategic dynamics that have defined the most successful venture capital investments of all time, from Microsoft to Cisco. Whether you want to know about the role of networking effects, lock-in/switching costs, or standards in propelling the most successful companies to dominance, this book is a good starting point. 

But as someone who is growing more interested in so-called 'frontier technology' or 'deep-technology' investing, I read the book with one framing question: "Can the lessons of the Gorilla Game generalize?" That is, are the investing precepts discussed in the book useful for the next generation of pioneering companies? 

The reason why this question matters is two fold: 

1. **The distribution of companies that Sand Hill Road funds is changing.** All the best investment firms, from deep-technology specialists like Lux Capital, to the stalwarts of the VC era, like Sequoia, to the newest entrants, like a16z, have started to make some investments outside the traditional consumer internet and enterprise software categories. I don't have hard data to back this up, but anecdotes support this assertion. For example, Bilal Zuberi, one of the preeminent 'deep-tech' investors discusses this phenomenon [here](https://medium.com/bz-notes/deeptech-frontiertech-is-finding-home-among-vcs-cdbf6baeb96a), and the general proclamation that we're at the [end of the current cycle](http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/07/end-of-cycle.html) of venture investing seems to have become the new norm. Thus, irrespective of what types of new investments the firms have turned to making (deep tech is composed of a heterogenous group of product categories), understanding which principles of successful venture investing translate to this new domain (and which ones don't) is a critical, if underdiscussed topic. 
2. **The competitive dynamics of successive computing and communications revolutions are not guaranteed to persist.** The Gorilla Game delves deep into a particular pattern of competition that seemed to persist amongst high-technology companies. I'll talk about this in more detail later, but in general, the type of competition that creates obscene growth rates, dominant firms in a particular product category, and the accompanying high-market capitalizations that have driven outlier returns for VCs are not guaranteed to occur in every new industry. For example, of the new companies formed in the industrial era, only a few (e.g. AT&T, RCA) brought to market products that exhibited similar competitive dynamics to modern high-technology firms. Venture-backed biotechnology and medical device companies have create a pharmacopeia of life-saving medical interventions over the last 30 years, but the competitive model (and the funding model) they employ is drastically different. And while everyone brings up this example, the clean-tech investing binge clearly demonstrated the dangers of expecting companies with drastically different economic profiles to exit at valuations similar to past venture investments in software and semiconductors. Basically, investing is driven by economic fundamentals and thus if the economic fundamentals of the future technology commercialization change, the funding model for that commercialization should change as well! Thus it's important to try to understand the competitive dynamics that will govern new product categories. 

Now before I begin I do want to note a critical caveat. The categories that currently define 'frontier technology', think artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, augmented reality, virtual reality, drones, robotics, autonomous vehicles, space/satellites, genomics, etc., are really heterogenous. And becasue of the diversity of this type of investing, it's going to be almost impossible to derive lessons that will apply equally well to all of the product categories listed above. 

With that, let's begin. 

## The Critical Assumptions of The Gorilla Game

In my opinion, the _The Gorilla Game_ attempts to answer 2 fundamental questions that have underpinned the dynamics of technology-investing for the past 40+ years. 

1. **Why do some product categories experience hypergrowth?**
2. **Why does that growth (and the associated economic value) result in a predictable distribution of economic returns amongst firms (the so-called, "Gorilla", "Monkey", and "Chimp")?** That is, why do these product categories result in a dominant firm?

### Explaining Hypergrowth 

VCs love fast growth. They're under constant pressure to exit their companies within 10 years (at maximum), and because longer exits tank their IRR, they want the company to grow their user base as well as their revenue quickly. Additionally, as this [McKinsey piece](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/grow-fast-or-die-slow) (aptly titled, 'Grow Fast or Die Slow') indicates, the market (both in the form of the public markets, as well as private acquirers) pays a premium for fast growth, even more so than for high margins (although the best venture investments have combined both)<sup>1








### Why One Firm?




1. Why this prioritization of growth over margin structure? The reasons are many and hard to completely delineate. But here's a summary. Firstly, growth means that you can have larger future revenues and thus cash flows, which makes any DCF model happy. Secondly, growth is a powerful signal that the company has tapped into a huge and desperate pain point. Investors are usually willing to assume that margin structures will work themselves out because lightning fast growth is a signal that the company has a defined competitive advantage over competitors and thus will likely not have margin issues. That is, past experience has shown a strong correlation between fast growth and high margins - companies like Microsoft, Cisco, etc., have all grown fast, but combined this growth with high margins. This is the fundamental crux of _The Gorilla Game_. Lastly, growth is **hard**.  If you crack open McKinsey's _Valuation_ textbook and flip to the section on growth, you'll come away with one key takeaway - market share shifts in a steady state competitive environment are marginal at best, even for firms with a distinct advantage manifesting in price or lower costs. So investors are willing to pay for reveue growth in excess of general economic growth rates because its so rare.
