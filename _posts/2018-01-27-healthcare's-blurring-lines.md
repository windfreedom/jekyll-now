For the last couple of years, the healthcare industry - specifically focused on providers and insurers - has engaged in a truly remarkable number of mergers and acquisitions. For example, in the [last month of 2017 alone](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20171226/NEWS/171229957) we saw mergers between the Ascension Health Providence and St. Joseph hospital systems, Advocate and Aurora Health Care, the contuing acquisition spree from UnitedHealth's Optum group, as well as the much discused $69 Billion acquisition of Aetna by CVS. And more gloablly, [Kaufman Hall & Associates ranked 2017 as the most acquisitive year on record](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180127/NEWS/180129937/record-numbers-better-credit-in-2017-mamp-a-dealmaking) since they started compiling data on hospital and health system deals in 2000. Many of these mergers have been horizontal: hospital chains getting bigger by combining their assets in different states, insurers trying (and generally failing) to combine, etc. But a new trend has also crept into the M&A landscape: **vertical mergers** of various types. Physician groups, even relatively large ones, have been joining local hospital-centered systems, continuing trends of consolidation that have been seen for a long while. However, in addition to the maintenance of this relatively long lived trend, two new ones emerged led by United Health Group and Aetna/CVS. United Health Group's acquisition spree of independent physician groups (IPAs), ambulatory surigcal centers and urgent care centers, which has been ongoing since at least the 2011 reorganization of the Optum subsidiary, continued with its $4.9 Billion acquisition of DaVita Group's outpatient care assets. CVS and Aetna on the other hand joined to create one of the first (if not **the** first) combination of insurer, PBM, pharmacy chain & distribution, as well as a network of retail clinics. It's these last two deals that I want to give particular scrutiny towards. What underlies the strategic motivation for the two deals? What do the two companies assume about the future that made them shell out so much cash? And are they right? 


## Trends toward Vertical Integration

While the CVS-Aetna merger and the continued expansion of United's python-esque grip on U.S. healthcare were the notable vertical expansions in 2017, the lines between different nodes in the healthcare value chain have been blurring for a long time now, generally catalyzed by regulatory change. 

Textbook treatments of the U.S. healthcare value chain generally divide into 5 functions, each occupied by a set of organizations:

- End-payers, in the form of governments (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.), individuals (made more important by the ACA exchanges), employers (both in the form of self-insured employers as well as those in the large group market). These institutions ultimately foot the bill for healthcare services in one form or another. 
- Fiscal Intermediaries f in the form of insurers, who offer a number of different types of products (HMOs, PPOs, wide-network plans), as well as Pharmacey Benefit Managers (PBMs). These organizations generally help blunt the high-cost of medical service for end-payers.
- Providers in the form of hospitals (inpatient), speciality surgical centers, outpatient care (physician clinics), pharmacy chains and newer types of delivery assets like urgent care centers, stand-alone ERs, etc. Each organization here takes on a different use case for the provision of healthare services and products to consumers. 
- Purchasers, like drug, medical device, and durable medical equipment (DME) wholesalers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that serve to bridge the gap between the products used in medical service and the service providers themselves.
- Producers like biopharmaceutical companies and medical device makers. They tend to actually make the products used in varying types of medical care.

But these lines have been blurred in the past and after a brief period of stablization in the mid-2000s, have started to blur again. 



## Two Very Different Bets on the Future of Healthcare

## A Value Based Care Angle?

## But what about Amazon?

If you've been paying attention thus far, you'll probably have noticed that I left out one very commonly cited reason behind the merger: the looming threat of Amazon's entrance into the healthcare market.
