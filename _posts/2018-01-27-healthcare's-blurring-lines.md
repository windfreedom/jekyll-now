For the last couple of years, the healthcare industry - specifically focused on providers and insurers - has engaged in a truly remarkable number of mergers and acquisitions. For example, in the [last month of 2017 alone](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20171226/NEWS/171229957) we saw mergers between the Ascension Health Providence and St. Joseph hospital systems, Advocate and Aurora Health Care, the contuing acquisition spree from UnitedHealth's Optum group, as well as the much discused $69 Billion acquisition of Aetna by CVS. And more gloablly, [Kaufman Hall & Associates ranked 2017 as the most acquisitive year on record](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180127/NEWS/180129937/record-numbers-better-credit-in-2017-mamp-a-dealmaking) since they started compiling data on hospital and health system deals in 2000. Many of these mergers have been horizontal: hospital chains getting bigger by combining their assets in different states, insurers trying (and generally failing) to combine, etc. But an apparently new trend has also crept into the M&A landscape: **vertical mergers** of various types. Physician groups, even relatively large ones, have joined local hospital-centered systems, continuing trends of consolidation that have been seen for a long while. Additionally, United Health Group's acquisition spree of independent physician groups (IPAs), ambulatory surigcal centers and urgent care centers, which has been ongoing since at least the 2011 reorganization of the Optum subsidiary, also continued with its $4.9 Billion acquisition of DaVita Group's outpatient care assets. CVS and Aetna on the other hand joined to create one of the first (if not **the** first) combination of insurer, PBM, pharmacy chain & distribution, as well as a network of retail clinics. Whether novel or not, it's clear then that the healthcare value chain is changing. But questions remain as to how the differet existing players are changing and why they are choosing to do so. Specifically, what strategies are the incumbents taking with respect to verticalization and what underlies their strategic motivation? 


## Trends toward Vertical Integration

Textbook treatments of the U.S. healthcare value chain generally divide into 5 functions, each occupied by a set of organizations:

- **End-payers**, in the form of governments (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.), individuals (made more important by the ACA exchanges), employers (both in the form of self-insured employers as well as those in the large group market). These institutions ultimately foot the bill for healthcare services in one form or another. 
- **Fiscal Intermediaries** in the form of insurers, who offer a number of different types of products (HMOs, PPOs, wide-network plans), as well as Pharmacey Benefit Managers (PBMs). These organizations generally help blunt the high-cost of medical service for end-payers.
- **Providers** in the form of hospitals (inpatient), speciality surgical centers, outpatient care (physician clinics), pharmacy chains and newer types of delivery assets like urgent care centers, stand-alone ERs, etc. Each organization here takes on a different use case for the provision of healthare services and products to consumers. 
- **Purchasers**, like drug, medical device, and durable medical equipment (DME) wholesalers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that serve to bridge the gap between the products used in medical service and the service providers themselves.
- **Producers**, such as biopharmaceutical companies and medical device makers. They tend to actually make the products used in varying types of medical care.

The CVS-Aetna merger and the continued expansion of United's python-esque grip on U.S. healthcare were the notable vertical expansions in 2017, but the lines between different the nodes in the healthcare value chain stated above have been blurring for a long time now, generally catalyzed by regulatory change. 


There are a couple of ways this trend towards value chain extension have been realized.

**1. Hospital Systems forward integrating by acquiring physician practices and other outpatient care assets.
**

This trend might not be so much of a surprise in 2017. But wind the clock back to say, 1990, and there truly was a distinct organizational barrier drawn between small and mid-sized physician groups and more intensive inpatient settings (usually owners of multiple hospitals organized into a 'health system', in which physicians were contracted or employed in a select number of specialties such as emergency medicine, radiology, anesthesiology, surgery, and pathology). However, as many once inpatient, and financially lucrative procedures began to migrate to outpatient settings like outpatient surgical and imaging centers, formerly inpatient-led organizations started to buy up smaller specialty physician groups to create 'networks' that could theoretically provide most - if not all - healthcare services. Especially relevant in recent years has been the extension of these principal to their logical conclusion:  acquisitions of PCP-practices, institutions that have been thus far the patient entry-point to the healthcare system. This forward integration has obvious financial advantages for health systems. 
-Firstly, as previously mentioned, it prevented the leakage of high-margin services to outpatient settings outside of the health system. 
-Secondly, control of the PCP allowed controls of referrals, ensuring that _patients_ didn't leak outside of the walls of the healthcare system. 
-Thirdly, the vertial consolidation allowed the hospital systems to gain market power that benefited them directly in negotiations with insurers. An insurer - even one with a narrow network product - has little in the way of leverage to extract price concessions if there is not a substitute provider to which the insurer can turn to. While horizontal integration did impact leverage as well, forward integration is also important in explaining market power beacuse it prevented the insurer from engaging in many individual negotiations with differenet (usually smaller) sites-of-care. Therefore, instead of being able to manage many smaller negotiations with provider groups for each type of care, the insurer is left with a 'take it or leave it' proposition for the entire vertical spectrum of care for its members, an undesirable position to be in to say the least. 
- Facility fees, which are payments made my Medicare (and thus, likely to be replicated by private insurers) for services conducted in outpatient settings that could be performed in a freestanding physician clinic, are available to hospitals that employ larger number of physicians in the outpatient setting. 
- Lastly, the re-emergence of value-based care payment models, specifically those embedded in the 2015 Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act  has provided yet another strategic (and marketing) motivation for vertical consolidation: care coordination and the regulatory burden of reporting. For smaller physician groups who have thus far held out against acquisition, the new Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) as well as the more advanced tracks of value-based payment, rely heavily on reported quality metrics which are onerous for small clinics to abide by. MedPAC clearly has been warned about these issues and is trying to compensate, but it's unclear whether their efforts will be successful. For larger systems, ACOs in particular make a pretty explicit monetary trade-off between specialist and inpatient services and primary care, arguing that we should be spending more on the latter. Thus, it makes sense for them to invest in the full-spectrum of care activities to try to control members utilization and healthcare costs. 

**2. Provider-led and Joint-Ventured Narrow Network Insurance Products.
**

While the last section was all about health systems intergrating forward into parts of the care spectrum outside that of the traditional inpatient hospital, this section refers to trends that see providers integrating **backwards** into functioning as health plan sponsors in some form or another. Unlike the acqusition of outpatient care assets, this trend is definitively newer on the scene. And because this trend is newer, the strategic logic surrounding these moves is not as fleshed out as it might be for the previous example. 






Narrow-networks products, that is, insurance product with a limited choice of doctors, are not new. If you are a consumer of U.S. healthcare over the age of 30, you probably remember the initial Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) craze that spread like wildfire in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The goal, inspired of the father of managed care Paul Ellwood, was pretty simple: reduce healthcare expenditures and lower premiums by limiting the size of the network a patient could see without forgoing insurance coverage, while encouraging utilization management through network design, and partially capitated payments to various parts of the network (e.g. fully-capitated primary care and payment to hospitals based on the Medicare DRG program). And for a while anyway, the idea did (theoretically) work: HMOs had all the financial incentives to shop for high value providers, had the data to make those decisions accurately, and the size to hammer out bargain prices. 

Problem was, consumers _hated_ them. Consumers wanted choice and only trusted physicians, not insurers, to make correct medical decisions. Hence any restriction in the provider options was anathema to consumer desires. Thus, the initial value-creation for employers was eventually trumped by value destruction for consumers.

But since the passage of the ACA, it appears that the narrow network is coming back, this time in a form started by, branded by, and led by the provider organization itself (as opposed to being launched by an insurance company) or through a joint-venture with an existing insurance company. The Cleveland Clinic for example just began to market a co-branded individual narrow network product with the insurance company Oscar Health. 



3. Provider-Insurer Mergers to form locally Integrated Health Systems in the guise of Kaiser Permanente or Geisinger. 




Most notably however, neither UHG's outpatient acquisition sprees nor the CVS-Aetna merger fit these traditional merger patterns.

## But what about Amazon?

If you've been paying attention to the media coverage of the merger trend, you probably have noticed that I left out one very commonly cited reason behind the merger: the looming threat of Amazon's entrance into the healthcare market.
