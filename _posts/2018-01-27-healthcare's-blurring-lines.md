For the last couple of years, the healthcare industry - specifically focused on providers and insurers - has engaged in a truly remarkable number of mergers and acquisitions. For example, in the [last month of 2017 alone](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20171226/NEWS/171229957) we saw mergers between the Ascension Health Providence and St. Joseph hospital systems, Advocate and Aurora Health Care, the contuing acquisition spree from UnitedHealth's Optum group, as well as the much discused $69 Billion acquisition of Aetna by CVS. And more gloablly, [Kaufman Hall & Associates ranked 2017 as the most acquisitive year on record](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180127/NEWS/180129937/record-numbers-better-credit-in-2017-mamp-a-dealmaking) since they started compiling data on hospital and health system deals in 2000. Many of these mergers have been horizontal: hospital chains getting bigger by combining their assets in different states, insurers trying (and generally failing) to combine. But a new trend has also crept into the M&A landscape: **vertical mergers** of various types. Physician groups, even relatively large ones, have been joining local systems, continuing trends of consolidation that have been seen for a long while. But in addition to the maintenance of this relatively long lived trend, two new ones emerged led by United Health Group and Aetna/CVS. United Health Group's acquisition spree, which has been ongoing since at least the 2011 reorganization of the Optum subsidiary, continued with its $4.9 Billion acquisition of DaVita Group's outpatient care assets, conisisting of medical clinics, urgent care centers (alternatives to hospital ER systems), and outpatient ambulatory surgical center. CVS and Aetna on the other hand joined to create one of the first (if not **the** first) combination of insurer, PBM, pharmacy chain & distribution, as well as a network of retail clinics.
