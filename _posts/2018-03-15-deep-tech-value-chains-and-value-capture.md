The picture displayed above, illustrated a fundamental shift in the value chain that occurred as the industry shifted from the mainframe era to the minicomputer and personal computer era. Andy Grove called this shift in industry structure  a strategic inflection point for the company - a time of rapid change that can either catapault a company to success or leadit to its downfall. For Intel this shift indeed was a SIP, because the competitive dynamics implied by this horizontal architecture, namely that of platforms and business ecosystems, were indispensable in transforming Intel from a struggling DRAM chip-maker to the dominant microprocessor manufacturer (that is, until a new value chain, that for the smartphone, displaced it).
