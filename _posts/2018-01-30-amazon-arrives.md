At long last, after close to a year of entry rumors and key hiring in its new "1492" group, including that of [Martin Levine from Iora Health](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/amazon-adds-top-iora-health-physician-to-healthcare-team.html), Amazon has officially [annouced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130005676/en/Amazon-Berkshire-Hathaway-JPMorgan-Chase-partner-U.S) its intentions to do..._something_ in healthcare. Officially, they say they are teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan "with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs....through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints". Problem is - as many skeptical health-technology commentators have noted - it isn't exactly divulging details about what it intends to do, and because we have nothing to critically analyze, it's quite easy to either hail or dismiss Amazon's triumvirate baed on intellectual priors. But still, the annoucement is very interesting even with only scant details about it plans.
