I don't like blog posts that start with personal announcements, so I apologize for the hypocrisy that is this post. But in this case, I think the personal update will preface some of the topics I'm going to discuss in the post. 

This summer, as a result of some meandering, cold emailing, and, most importantly, the generosity of Adam Gouldburn and Zavain Dar at Lux , I am going to be starting a position as a summer associate at Lux Capital, a firm famous for their relentless focus on so-called 'deep-tech' or 'frontier-tech' investing.  I've long admired Lux for this deep committment to finding and investing in businesses that use  radical advances in technology as the fundamental basis for both their value creation and value capture strategies - a truly contrarian strategy even in an age when the meaning of that term has been diluted. As part of preparing to join them this summer, as well as part of my own interest in the practice of 'deep-technology' investing, I've attempted to explore the area more deeply, and in doing so, have come across a few key questions and controversial areas that I'd like clarify and disseminate my thoughts on. This post is an attempt to do just that. 

## Topic 1: First of all, what is 'deep-tech', 'frontier-tech', or 'hard-tech' investing?

There are a lot of definitions for 'deep-tech', 'frontier-tech', and/or 'hard-tech' investing floating around there, partly because all three phrases all evolved as  catch-call terms to differentiate certain startups and venture firms from the modern startup ecosystem's focus on developing the application-layer software businesses that have driven imaginations and returns post-2000.  Let's recap some of them:

- Investing in companies that develop products incorporating some 'non-software' element (e.g. semiconductors, robotics, cars, rockets, biotech - all are included). 
- Investing in computer hardware companies (e.g. memory chips, storage, peripherals, handsets/devices, etc.)
- Investing in companies attempting to build the next generation of fundamental computing 'platforms', e.g. VR/AR hardware and software, AI infrastructure and applications, etc. 
- Companies operating in the world of 'atoms', as opposed to 'bits.
- Companies sellling to "important" markets related to energy generation and storage, agricultural productivity, sustainability, transporatation, housing, healthcare, etc. 

I think all the definitions are to a certain extent accurate descriptions of the investing processes of the best so-called 'deep-tech' investors.. But none of them are based in the principles underpinning successful new company formation. My definition, which attempts to take these factors into account, is as follows:

> **A deep technology company is one that is attempting to commercialize a product that is only made possible due to a order-   of-magnitude change in technological capabilities, a change that is driven (and developed) by the company in question. Additionally, the change in technological capabilities is closely related to the companies ability to create value for customers and build defensibility **


I think this definition is broad enough

## Topic 2: Why is Deep-Tech Interesting?

The canonical history of the venture capital industry places its beginnings in the late-1940s with George Doriot's founding of ARDC and subsequent funding of DEC. The canonical history of the 'technology' industry places its beginnings somwhere between the creation of IBM and its tabulating machines,and the birth of Fairchild Semiconductor. Both are overly restrcitive to their respective instutions. This posits the 'technology' industry that which 

I think that anybody who wants to understand, at it's most fundamental level, the nature technical innovation and its relation to  value creation and the formation of new businesses has to expand their study to include the time period from 1850 - 1925. Three books, _Creating the Twentieth Century_ and _Transforming the Twentieth Century_ by Valcav Smil, as well as _Engines that Move Markets_ by Alasdair Nairn (hard to find) chronicle the rapid invention and commercialization 


## Topic 3: Should Silicon Valley Stick to Software? Is Software Special?

## Topic 4: The False Dichotomy Between 'Software' and 'Hard-Tech' Investing.

As indicated by Topic 3, for a while now (according to Marc Andreesseen, at least since the Internet Bubble in 2000) 

## Topic 5: Risk and Models of Successful New Company Entrance. 
## Topic 6: Thinking About Capital Intensity in Deep-Tech Companies.
