If I was forced to use one word to describe the the healthcare industry at end of 2017, I'd call the industry **merged**.


The sheer number and scale of M&A transactions in 2017 was staggering. We saw hospital large national hospital systems like Aurora  and Advocate Healthcare combine to create a cross-state system arguably worth $10.7 Billion; industry giants like UnitedHealthGroup expanded through the acquisition of DaVita Medical Group's outpatient dialysis clinics, and most famously,  CVS and Aetna decided to merge in a $69 Billion move that created perhaps the first large-scale combination of an insurer and pharmacy chain. While many will worringly focus on the horizontal mergers and the formation of large, dominant hospitals, I think the more interesting strategic phenomenon derives from the  deals involving the two insurers: Aetna and United. 

Both United, through its Optum care subsidiary (which bought the DaVita clinics) and Aetna, through its recent merger with CVS,  engaged in a practice that has become more common in the post-ACA healthcare landscape: a vertical merger. That is, instead of buying a competitor that operates at a similar level of the value chain - one that processes and pays out claims for healthcare services like a traditional health insurer might - they've bought companies that operate perform different services. For UnitedHealthGroup - the largest healthcare company in the U.S. and the 800 LB gorilla of the healthcare market  - this move was just a continuation of a strategy they've employed for years, buying various local group practices, independent physician associations (IPAs), urgent care centers (low-cost substitutes for hospital ERs), and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) to handle lower-acuity oupatient procedures. For CVS and Aetna however, the merger was far from business as-usual. Most individuals probably know CVS as a pharmacy chain and convinience store. Given the fact that there's an [82% chance you live within 10-minutes of a CVS location](https://qz.com/1146577/cvs-and-aetna-aet-82-of-americans-are-within-10-miles-of-the-pharmacy/), you likely have visited the chain at least once to get a prescription filled. However, the company operates in many more lines of busines. Most importantly, it also operates CVS-Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and a set of minute clinics that are located both in its own locations as well as in grocery stores like Target. Aetna on the other hand is a traditional diversified insurer, operating in a variety of segments of the health insurance market. 

So what does this all mean for the state of the healthcare industry? There are a couple of key 

## Vertical Integration and the Blurring of Traditional Healthcare Lines

Vertical integration in healthcare is not a new phenomenon. In fact, some the nation's most prestigious healthcare institutions: The Cleveland Clinic, Geisinger Health Systems,Kaiser Permanente, and the Mayo Clinic are all vertically integrated combinations of provider organizations and insurers. Consumers in California for instance, can buy insurance plans from the Kaiser Foundation Health Plans that function as pre-paid plans for any of Kaiser's owned physician groups and hospitals. In fact, the vision of the healthcare market consisting of many competing pre-paid group practices paid on a capitated basis lines up broadly with the vision for U.S. healthcare promoted by some of the earliest health economists such as Paul Ellwood (the man who invented the HMO) and Alain Enthoven in the 1970s and 1980s. But chances are, despite the model's prevalence in certain small pockets of the U.S., your local physicians and specialists don't practice under that model. Why is that and has something changed recently?

There are several key reasons.

Firstly,
