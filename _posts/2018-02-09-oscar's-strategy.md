NYC-based Oscar Health is the poster-child of the new era of technology-enabled startups attempting to enter the healthcare industry. What started as the dream of current-CEO Mario Schlosser and his founding team has matured over the last 5 years into a full-blown health insurance company, covering close to 250,000 lives and projected to make $1.25 billion in revenue in 2018. It's captured the imagination of the public and members by promising everything that current inusurers don't: simplicity and consumer delight. 

But even with those numbers and financial backing from some of Silicon Valley's smartest money ((Google Ventures, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures, and Founders Fund to name a few early investors), Oscar remains a  fascinating and controversial company for many individuals. 

For one, it was a **bold** bet. Health insurance is not an easy business to get into - especially when the founding team had absolutely no experience in the industry. Even just getting a product to the market requires building a network of physicians that meet network adequacy laws - it's no good having a network without any surgical oncologists in it! And building that network required actually sitting down with providers and hammering out contracts that determine what price Oscar is going to pay for provider services. Knowing what those contracts look like, what good benchmarks are, is something that's hard to do without any experience. And to top it all off, you don't get consumer leeway in this business. Mistakes can permanently stain the reputation of a company and make it hard to acquire customers. 

The competitive dynamics of the industry didn't look all that attractive either. Health insurance is an extremely concentrated industry where scale has been the primary route to competitive advantage. It's dominated by 4-5 major players who have either been around since the begining of the health insurance industry in the 1930s or latched on to the growth of HMO plans in the late 1980s to get to scale before diversifying. UnitedHealthGroup, Anthem, Aetna, Humana, and Cigns all generate over $30 Billion in revenue, have market capitalizations exceeding $20 Billion, and are thus formidable competitors (e.g. see my piece on UHG's outpatient strategy here). Without the number of members that the incumbents could bring to bear, individuals struggled to see how Oscar could construct a network in which they wouldn't be a price taker to increasingly concentrated provider systems - suffering large losses as a result. 

And lastly - unlike the _very_ profitable Medicare Advantage market segment (ARPU is around 2x the average individual ARPU depeding on risk adjustment, churn is lower), in which  many new startups (e.g. Devoted Health, Clover Health) have launched, Oscar launched on the Obamacare individual exchanges. For the first few years at least, these exchanges were bloodbaths for insurers. [United](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170418/NEWS/170419876), [Humana](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/14/humana-says-it-plans-to-pull-out-of-obamacare-exchanges-in-2018.html), Aetna and the other large insurers pulled out citing huge losses (although [the Florida Blues](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160615/NEWS/160619946) in particular have noted a 17% gross margin - which for the ACA exchanges is very impressive indeed) of up to $1 Billion over two years. The economics of these exchanges seemed at odds with Oscar's product's strategy. Consumers are price sensistive, churn is high (commercial markets generally keep customers for ~1 year, no more), and risk-adjustment means that an insurer can be penalized for having too healthy a class of individuals. Those three variables don't look great when you plug them into a LTV model.

And yet, they do appear to be doing the little-things right. A quick gander about their blog demonstrates how well they've come to understand the business they're in. 

- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/this-is-not-a-bill-oscars-journey-to-create-a-better-eob) they describe their approach to creating a better Explanation of Benefits statement (which is the letter you get from your insurance company after you use services; it's usually unreadably complicated).
- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/better-claims-processing-better-health-care-experience) they explain how claims processing systems work.
- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/gabe-switches-doctors-a-health-care-story) they explain how difficult it was for one of their own executives to switch doctors, illustrating some of the problems patients face when trying to navigate the health care system.
- [Here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/connecting-the-dots-with-the-clinical-dashboard) they describe their clinical dashboard that both providers and members can access. 
- They've made [using telemedicine](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/virtual-care-future-smart-fast-interconnected-alan-warren/) a much bigger priority than most insurers 
-  Many insurers can't even properly maintain provider lists because the data about providers they use is so unreliable. So Oscar tried to design
- And topping it all off, they describe their approach to network building [here](https://www.hioscar.com/blog/a-new-kind-of-health-insurance-network).

I recently got to visit the Oscar HQ in SoHo, and it's obvious that they've put together a stunning team. Everyone I met with was humble and honest about what they did know, and what they didn't; what capabilities they were bootstrapping, building and which ones remained outside the company. The mix of individuals from traditional healthcare backgrounds, e.g. former operational leaders from HCA, former policy researchers and analysts, economists, actual doctors, (even a physiscist turned data scientist!) all combined with amazing technical talent, was amazing to see first-hand and perfectly keeping with what you'd expect from an insurer that also happens to be a software company. And they all talked about how much they still wanted to learn about the system. If I had to evaluate the company from the standpoint of personnell alone, I'd immediately invest. 

The problem is, as strategy legend Michael Porter loves to point out - **[operational excellence is not strategy](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62a5/6cb47ec0a181da67358662446ab7d544c01f.pdf)**. Rather, irrespective of the industry chosen or product/service marketed, for a firm to  achieve sustained returns above the cost of capital and above those of the competition (and thus capture enough of the value it creates for customers), it must engage in activities that both materially increase cash flow (by increasing the price the company can charge without bleeding volume, by reducing the costs necessary to serve the business without compromising product quality, or by allowing it to take market share without expending excess capital that would depress returns) and do so in a way that is not easily imitable (that is, some of its activities must be unique in some way). 

So is Oscar a company that's going to truly revolutionize the healthcare industry by changing the rules of competition in the healthcare industry? Or is it just another small insurer doomed to be eternally subscale and thus at the mercy of industry economics?
