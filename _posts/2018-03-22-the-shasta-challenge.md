 Shasta is hiring an investment associate!
 
 Two short writing exercises: 1) pick a company in our portfolio that you respect most and tell us why. Then tell us which company we shouldn’t have invested in, and why; and 2) Tell us about a new market that you think is important — one that you would be interested to “map”– and how you would go about that.
