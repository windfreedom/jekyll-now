title: Dynamics of Competitive Advantage From First Principles
published: true

## Introduction 

I’ve recently started reading the book _7 Powers: The Foundations of Business Strategy_ on the recommendation of Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures. The book, which one can consider a expanded, more fundamental version of Porter’s Competitive Strategy classic, is a good overview of corporate strategy. I would recommend anyone who has some free time to give it a read. However, I wanted to discuss an aspect of the book that consistently nagged me while reading it. The author, a former BCG consultant and economist, divides the book into two sections, the former describing competitive _statics_ — what set of characteristics and situations define durable competitive advantage at a particular point in time — and the other describing competitive _dynamics_  — how competitive advantage is both gained and lost over time (focusing on the gaining). This distinction is crucial because while I read Part I of the novel in general agreement and interest, Part II left me wanting. And the lack of a solid theoretical grounding for governing the dynamics of capitalism is not just something I found lacking with this book. Rather, most of what I’ve read about the topic has left me dissatisfied. 

Given that the process of industrial change — the birth and death of industries, the emerging of new corporate titans and the reinvention of old ones — is so fundamentally critical to economic growth and the mythos capitalism more broadly, it strikes me as odd that we do not yet have (or I don't yet know about) a defining paradigm for governing how to think about its causes. That is, we don’t yet have a 'go-to' framework for analyzing dynamics, one that holds a similar position to Porter’s 5 Forces. 

So I thought I would attempt to derive a theory of competitive dynamics on my own from first principles, one that can explain more example of industry change than I believe existing theories can. As an aspiring venture investor,  I’m primarily interested in  the impact of _technological change_ on the dynamics of competitive advantage. That is, how and when does technology enable new company formation and success? When do incumbents win? When do new companies? Technological change is not the only facet of industrial mutation of course. Rather, because it is of practical importance to venture capitalists — even baby ones like myself — and to other stakeholders who are betting millions of dollars on technology-driven change, it tends to be discussed more prominently in the literature. 

## Business Models as a Starting Point

Before one can think about change, one must have a theory of business to use as a starting  point. I begin with a description of an incumbent firms’ **business model**. The term business model, like many qualitative terms used in business, carries with it multiple interpretations and definitions. Mine is pretty much stolen from this 2002 Harvard Business Review article, [“Why Business Models Matter”](https://hbr.org/2002/05/why-business-models-matter). To quote Joan Magretta, business models are:

> “stories — stories that explain how enterprises work. A good business model answers Peter Drucker’s age-old questions, ‘Who is the customer? And what does the customer value?’ It also answers the fundamental questions every manager must ask: How do we make money in this business? What is the underlying economic logic that explains how we can deliver value to customers at an appropriate cost?”

To me, this means the following. I give you one piece of paper, and using it, explain, in detail, the entire business to me (where business is defined around one single product/service or small numbers of related ones, not an entire firm). 
That is a daunting task, and one that encompasses a larger number of factors, both internal to and external of the firm. Here’s my picture of what should go on that one page - the totality of elements that define a business:


A firm has to have a product or service — something it produces and sells in a market that hopefully provides value to someone. That product (I will stop using the ‘or service’ addition here,  but most of what I say is applicable to services as well as products) is inextricable from the set of customer segments who value that product to some degree, because it fulfills a need or want. That value embodied in the product to a certain set of customers has lot of names, Core Product Value, Value Proposition, etc., and has a distinct magnitude associated with it that generally (generally!) corresponds to the customers willingness to pay for the product. Also note that I use the word ‘segments’ as opposed to the singular ‘segment’ for good reason — its very possible for one product to be useful to multiple segments of the customer, who could differ in 
Part of that magnitude of value generated has to be captured in some form by the company (otherwise, it has no hope of generating a profit). The way the firm captures value from its customers defines the firm’s revenue model. 
A firm also has to get the product in the hands of the customer who values it using distribution channels, which could take the form of selling the product to a retailer for a markdown, or could be selling directly to the customer via a platform like Amazon Marketplace. 





.
What I’ve just done is paint a static picture of a particular business. The critical thing to note about the picture is that every single element of the picture, whether external or internal to the firm, rests on a set of assumptions. The firm assumes that the product provides a certain amount of value by solving a certain problem — in reality the product may or may not. The firm assumes that the customers’ needs and wants (the ‘job to be done’) match what the product offers — this may or may not be true in reality.
