When most VCs get asked the question: "How do you evaluate investment opportunities?" (or some variation of that question), most have a fairly generic response. Make sure you're in a fast-growing (and eventually, really big) market. Solve a real pain point for your customers ('Vitamins not aspirin'). Have a dynamite team tailored for the job at hand. Make sure the product can be good enough to find product-market fit, if not the best possible product in the category.  Think about whether the business is defensibile (and therefore can generate good, sometimes grat, margins). Etc. Etc. There are often other things discussed too, but you get the point.

This answer is just generic enough to be both _right_ - these factors in a company are **very** important and thus universally considered by every investor - and not detailed enough to satiate me. The answer also falls in line with what people want to believe about venture - that it's _simple_ but _difficult_. The idea that you should look at the market, team, product, and  defensibility is a very _simple_ framework for investing, but one that's probably devilishly difficult to get work in practice. And I agree with that sentiment. But still, this answer has never sat well with me - it's always seemed like the "Venture Captial 101" answer, designed to be right but also designed to hide nuances. As someone who wants to be in this industry for the long run, it therefore seemed obvious to me that I should try and go find the "Venture Capital 200" answer and really explore the nuances.

I didn't find one good framework that gave me all the answers - nor should I have expected too. If there was just one 'right' framework with which to analyze technology investing, everyone would build their investment strategies around it and by definition, there would be no outsized returns. However, what I did find was that by reading broadly about the history of technology businesses (beyond just the ICT revolution and back all the way to the 1800s), as well as literature from corporate finance, corporate strategy, business schools, and economists, I came accross 5-6 core mental models that I would always refer to and modify when I was trying to explain or analyze a startup success or failure. So I thought I would write about those core frameworks and explain some of the modifications I made to them to make them more useful to me.  

The point of these frameworks is to shine a more nuanced light on the characteristics that make for a successful, relatively large, durable, new entrant (a 'startup'). I'm explicitly _not_ only focusing on the characteristics of a good investment. The point is, that by shining a light on successful company formation, investors like myself will also benefit (even if their first order concern is not long term durability, but the exit, which sometimes - unfortunately - it is).

**Competition sucks.** If you take one thing away from this entire framework, it should be a healthy respect for what competition can do to a business.
