At long last, after close to a year of entry rumors and key hiring in its new "1492" group, including that of [Martin Levine from Iora Health](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/amazon-adds-top-iora-health-physician-to-healthcare-team.html), Amazon  officially [annouced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130005676/en/Amazon-Berkshire-Hathaway-JPMorgan-Chase-partner-U.S) its intentions to do..._something_ in healthcare. Officially, they say they are teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan "with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs....through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints". Whatever that means.

Problem is - as many skeptical health-technology commentators have noted - it isn't exactly divulging details about what it intends to do. And because we have nothing to critically analyze, it's quite easy to either hail or dismiss Amazon's triumvirate based solely on one's intellectual priors. Those positively predisposed to Jeff Bezos, Arch-Capitalist and Destroyer of Industries can easily point to facts that support the view that the new partnership will be successful. But those familiar with the many failed attempts to transform healthcare - some undertaken by employer coalitions eerily similar to the one just announced - also can point to facts that indicate that Amazon is out of its depth and will fail. 

Unfortunately for those hoping for a radical rethink of care delivery from a famously innovative company, JPM CEO Jamie Dimon let it slip that the plan at the moment seems to form a Group Purchasing Organization (GPO), an approach that has been tried and failed before. But this piece will not be dedicated to analyzing the conservative scenario. Rather I will focus on what the radical ideas Amazon might try to deploy. 

That being said, before I get into the details of what Amazon is likely to do in healthcare, I think their entrance has surfaced an important topic that doesn't get fundamentally talked about. That is, **why is it so hard to change healthcare? **

It's a broad question. And it's a topic that is often analyzed from a variety of different perspectives. There's the policy perspective for example - why is so hard to get effective healthcare reform passed and why does it tend to suck once passed? The economic perspective tries to explain how the healthcare system can be so unresponsive to the needs of consumers and evidence. 

But I'm more interested in a subset of the general question: **why is so hard for new healthare entrants with innovative approaches to improve care delivery to gain market share?**


I believe this is a good lens from which to think about healthcare in light of Amazon's announcement. We can and _should_ debate whether it is [the job of private corporations to fix U.S. Healthcare](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/amazon-shouldnt-be-in-charge-of-fixing-health-care.html), or whether the problems endemic to the U.S. healthcare system indeed _can_ be fixed by private enterprises. However, while the goverment does play an outsized role  in the delivery and financing of healthcare, the U.S. operates in a nominally market driven system. Thus, it falls to private enteprises, from small clinics to delivery systems to corporations like Amazon to try to implement the innovative ideas that could lower healthcare costs and make it more consumer friendly. The government, for better or worse, can't order new ideas into existence. 

And from that perspective, the ability of new innovations to spread - usually brought to market by new entrants (startups) - and thus gain market share is  a critical topic to discuss. In most industries, while most startups with new products, processes, and business models fail, some of them succeed and do so by_ growing really quickly_, often backed by venture capital. Growth is everything to new companies. Actual venture capitalists will back me up on this point. And thus, the question of why new entrants (and more broadly, new _ideas_) in healthcare have trouble getting to any degree of national scale is of tantamount importance to the broader question of interest: why healthcare sucks. It's not clear that private entperise, optimized to get us to part with our hard earned dollars, is in a place to reduce overall health spending by the amounts necessary to bend the cost curve. But healthcare is broken in a myriad of other ways than simply price: the consumer experience is terrible, convinience is non existent, seamless communication amongst doctors is always just around the corner but never seems to get here, etc. New companies and new approaches should be able to fix _that_ at least, right? 


Not if they can't grow and get to scale. The evidence from the last 20 years of attempts to subsantially change the opaque, wasteful, and frustrating care delivery apparatus  confirms just how difficult it is to get new ideas to scale in the healthcare market. Listing the ideas that have failed to live up to their promise is depressing, but I will do it anyways:

- Bundled Payment Models
- HMOs (Managed Care 1.0)
- Centers of Excellence
- ACOs (decimal point savings, gradually infiltrating the private market, but with unclear benefits)
- Patient Centered Medical Homes (remember them?)
- Price Transparency Initiatives coupled with High-Deductible Benefit Design to encourage shopping. 
- EHRs, PHRs, and more generally, most attempts to leverage software to change care patterns.  
- Convinience Care to replace unnecessary ER visits. 
- Self-insurance and direct contracting for large to midsized employers. 
- Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) to pool leverage.
- Telemedicine
- Alternative Primary Care Models (DPC, new insurance products, etc.)
- Reference Pricing (evidence of success but not widely used). 

To add to the importance of _market share_ as the key factor to focus on, consider that several of these ideas have shown promise in limited settings. Reference pricing for example has been [deployed by CalPERS](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20150707.049155/full/) to succesfully reduce the wide variation in prices that it paid for its members healthcare. But its not employed unversally in benefit designs. On the other side of the spectrum, EHRs have finally (after years) reached market penetrance in the U.S., but only after the government literally paid physicians to use them while converting the open design space of software into a set of boxes that had to be checked. Without government carrots and sticks the market had no interest in widespread adoption of EMRs. 

Why have all these approaches failed to reach appreciable market share? 



Healthcare is a goldmine of textbook market failures thriving on (1) incentive misalignment (2) information asymmetry and (3) a system frozen by byzantine contracting and regulatory structures, highly scaled incumbents operating highly scalable processes and local market entry barriers which ensure that share shifts are glacial. Innovation is kept comfortably on the margins.

But how should we begin speculating in a way that gives us even a chance at making those speculations intellectually useful? I see 2 ways forward: 
1. Analyze the strategies by Amazon has approached new industries and product-markets in the past. 
2. Understand how employers have attempted to curb their employees healthcare costs in the past.

With those two pieces of background in mind, we can attempt to at least understand what Amazon and co. is likely to try and understand whether it's likely to work or not. 

## Amazon, Primitives, and Adaptation

Let's start with Amazon. Amazon is a hard company to thematically come to terms with. At first glance their core businesses of AWS, E-commerce logistics platform, as well as now its efforts in 'smart' consumer electronics and groceries,appear eclectically put together and very different from one another.  However, two [fantastic](https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/) [articles](https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/) by Ben Thompson help shed light on three key traits that Amazon's business ventures seem to share. 

1. Amazon has a **goal** of taking a cut of all economic activity - and is willing to be flexible on both the **strategies** and **tactics** necessary to achieve their goals. For example, Amazon has not taken the same tactics to dominate the cloud computing market as it has to become a leading logistics and E-commerce platform. In fact they don't even use remotely the same business model for each. And with their acquisition of Whole Foods, they have shown that they are willing to face the reality of the economics of a new industry they enter. Instead of simply trying to replicate their competitve model for E-commerce of physical goods in their  grocery entry play, they understood thatthe nature of scale and the nature of the product being sold were radically different. With this recognition, Amazon tacked and acquired Whole Foods as a way to get its grocery operations to scale quickly. 
2. Amazon's new ventures have often started around bootstrapping a product idea that is intitially valuable **internally** to Amazon's own employees, but has the potential to be replicated at scale nationally. The story of the founding of AWS is the best example of this: fascinated by the idea of "primitves" detailed in a book called "Creation" by Steve Grand, Bezos patterned AWS as a way of creative primitive computing blocks that could be valuable internally to Amazon's own teams. The investment was worth it just on the basis of its internal value; only later, after the modularized infrastructure was used internally, was the model opened up to external customers. The point is that Amazon rarely builds custom solutions to its internal problems that apply **only** to its particular internal problems. Rather, they tend to focus on modular solutions to problems faced by may external agents, including itself. 
3. Amazon is relentlessly focused on **scale** as a source of competitive advantage. One of the key themes that ties together Amazon's disparate businesses is the fact that the part of the value chain they choose to own and make money on are almost always characterized by massive fixed costs of R&D and installation, but also benefit from economies of scale (either on the supply side or the deamnd side) - two economic characteristics that form the potential for a deep moat. This is true of the massive computing infrastructure that was necessary to deploy AWS, as well as the massive warehouses and other physical assets necessary to maintain and efficiently run their logistics business. It's also true of their new Amazon Go store and the grocery delivery service that they are currently building. 


## Employers and Health Costs

Every company (in the U.S. at least) is a healthcare company. It's just a fact. The realities of the tax-privileged status of employer-sponsored health insurance (employer contributions towards health expenditures) been exempt from taxation since 1943) make it such that employers sponsor  healthcare for around 50% of the U.S. population and due the continually rising cost of paying those premiums, companies like Starbucks and G.M. often spend more on health insurance than they do on the raw materials for the actual products they sell. Think about that: G.M. spends more on healthcare for its employees than on steel to make cars. 

The effects of employer-sponsored health insurance of course, are very perverse. Firstly, the privileged tax status of health insurance contributions encouraged companies to divert more of shared savings to health insurance as opposed to wage increases (it was cheaper to do so!). Secondly, it's the [nations largest tax ependiture](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/upshot/the-real-reason-the-us-has-employer-sponsored-health-insurance.html). Thirdly, because part of the premium cost is eaten by the employer, employees are insulated from the sticker shock of healthcare price increases - they eventually suffer the consequences in the form of lower wages, but the lack of sticker shock leads to moral hazard and overutilization. And that's just the start - it would take a whole book to describe the effects of choosing to privilege employer-sponsored insurance on the U.S. healthcare system (I recommend _Code Red_ by David Dranove). But ultimately, right now we're focused on costs **to employers**. 

So, given the outsized costs of health insurance on employer cash balances, they should have been doing everything in their power to lower healthcare costs for the last 40 years, a time during which healthcare costs have ballooned. The good news (for our sanity) is that they did try and continue to lower expenditures! Unfortunately for us, they've also mostly failed and continue to fail. Why is that?

At a high level, while I'm I'm sure employers would like to spend nothing on healthcare and extricate themselves from the process of purchasing health insurance entirely, they've been constrained by the fact that health insurance is a critical factor in maintaining a competitive position in hiring markets. So, while employees don’t like high premiums, what they hate even more (partly due to the blunted impact of cost in employer-markets) is a less comprehensive benefits package. More generally, employees have an expectation of what a comprehensive health plan looks like, and generally don't like deviations from it, even if that deviation is in an effort to make their care cheaper or better. Therefore, despite the occasional story about companies drastically reducing health expenses through innovative benefit design, on average employers have bowed to the wishes of their employee bases and kept their benefits stadardized. 

But, as I mentioned above, the broad failure of employer efforts is not for a lack of trying  - and there have been a sparing number of large successes combined with a host of benefit design methods that have small, but proven effects. I'll try to briefly give an overview of the methods of benefit design that have been tried (ad some that haven't) thus far:

- Direct Contracting and Self-Insurance.
- Pooled employer consortiums to increase buyer power.
- Reference Pricing
- Use of Centers of Excellence for high-complexity cases. 
- Value Based Insurance Design (also known as 'intelligent use of cost sharing') 
- Narrowed and Tiered Networks



## Putting it All Together. 

So, given what we know about Amazon's tendencies as well as prior attempts at using benefit design to bend the cost curve, what might we expect Amazon to do?
