At long last, after close to a year of entry rumors and key hiring in its new "1492" group, including that of [Martin Levine from Iora Health](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/amazon-adds-top-iora-health-physician-to-healthcare-team.html), Amazon has officially [annouced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180130005676/en/Amazon-Berkshire-Hathaway-JPMorgan-Chase-partner-U.S) its intentions to do..._something_ in healthcare. Officially, they say they are teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan "with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs....through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints". Problem is - as many skeptical health-technology commentators have noted - it isn't exactly divulging details about what it intends to do, and because we have nothing to critically analyze, it's quite easy to either hail or dismiss Amazon's triumvirate based solely on one's intellectual priors. But still, the annoucement is very interesting even with only scant details available, both because we all _want_ them to succeed (who does't want lower healthcare costs?), but also because Amazon has a verifiable history of approaching new industries and finding winning strategies in them. 

But how should we begin speculating in a way that gives us even a chance at making those speculations intellectually useful? I see 2 ways forward: 
1. Analyze the strategies by Amazon has approached new industries and product-markets in the past. 
2. Understand how employers have attempted to curb their employees healthcare costs in the past.

With those two pieces of background in mind, we can attempt to at least understand what Amazon and co. is likely to try and understand whether it's likely to work or not. 

## Amazon, Primitives, and Adaptation

Let's start with Amazon. Amazon is a hard company to thematically come to terms with. At first glance their core businesses of AWS, E-commerce logistics platform, as well as now its efforts in 'smart' consumer electronics and groceries,appear eclectically put together and very different from one another.  However, two [fantastic](https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/) [articles](https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/) by Ben Thompson help shed light on three key traits that Amazon's business ventures seem to share. 

1. Amazon has a **goal** of taking a cut of all economic activity - and is willing to be flexible on both the **strategies** and **tactics** necessary to achieve their goals. For example, Amazon has not taken the same tactics to dominate the cloud computing market as it has to become a leading logistics and E-commerce platform. In fact they don't even use remotely the same business model for each. And with their acquisition of Whole Foods, they have shown that they are willing to face the reality of the economics of a new industry they enter. Instead of simply trying to replicate their competitve model for E-commerce of physical goods in their  grocery entry play, they understood thatthe nature of scale and the nature of the product being sold were radically different. With this recognition, Amazon tacked and acquired Whole Foods as a way to get its grocery operations to scale quickly. 
2. Amazon's new ventures have often started around bootstrapping a product idea that is intitially valuable **internally** to Amazon's own employees, but has the potential to be replicated at scale nationally. The story of the founding of AWS is the best example of this: fascinated by the idea of "primitves" detailed in a book called "Creation" by Steve Grand, Bezos patterned AWS as a way of creative primitive computing blocks that could be valuable internally to Amazon's own teams. The investment was worth it just on the basis of its internal value; only later, after the modularized infrastructure was used internally, was the model opened up to external customers. The point is that Amazon rarely builds custom solutions to its internal problems that apply **only** to its particular internal problems. Rather, they tend to focus on modular solutions to problems faced by may external agents, including itself. 
3. Amazon is relentlessly focused on **scale** as a source of competitive advantage. One of the key themes that ties together Amazon's disparate businesses is the fact that the part of the value chain they choose to own and make money on are almost always characterized by massive fixed costs of R&D and installation, but also benefit from economies of scale (either on the supply side or the deamnd side) - two economic characteristics that form the potential for a deep moat. This is true of the massive computing infrastructure that was necessary to deploy AWS, as well as the massive warehouses and other physical assets necessary to maintain and efficiently run their logistics business. It's also true of their new Amazon Go store and the grocery delivery service that they are currently building. 


## Employers and Health Costs

Every company (in the U.S. at least) is a healthcare company. It's just a fact. The realities of the tax-privileged status of employer-sponsored health insurance (employer contributions towards health expenditures) been exempt from taxation since 1943) make it such that employers sponsor  healthcare for around 50% of the U.S. population and due the continually rising cost of paying those premiums, companies like Starbucks and G.M. often spend more on health insurance than they do on the raw materials for the actual products they sell. Think about that: G.M. spends more on healthcare for its employees than on steel to make cars. 

The effects of employer-sponsored health insurance of course, are very perverse. Firstly, the privileged tax status of health insurance contributions encouraged companies to divert more of shared savings to health insurance as opposed to wage increases (it was cheaper to do so!). Secondly, it's the [nations largest tax ependiture](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/upshot/the-real-reason-the-us-has-employer-sponsored-health-insurance.html). Thirdly, because part of the premium cost is eaten by the employer, employees are insulated from the sticker shock of healthcare price increases - they eventually suffer the consequences in the form of lower wages, but the lack of sticker shock leads to moral hazard and overutilization. And that's just the start - it would take a whole book to describe the effects of choosing to privilege employer-sponsored insurance on the U.S. healthcare system (I recommend _Code Red_ by David Dranove). But ultimately, right now we're focused on costs **to employers**. 

So, given the outsized costs of health insurance on employer cash balances, they should have been doing everything in their power to lower healthcare costs for the last 40 years, a time during which healthcare costs have ballooned. The good news (for our sanity) is that they did try and continue to lower expenditures! Unfortunately for us, they've also mostly failed and continue to fail. Why is that?

At a high level, while I'm I'm sure employers would like to spend nothing on healthcare and extricate themselves from the process of purchasing health insurance entirely, they've been constrained by the fact that health insurance is a critical factor in maintaining a competitive position in hiring markets. So, while employees donâ€™t like high premiums, what they hate even more (partly due to the blunted impact of cost in employer-markets) is a less comprehensive benefits package. More generally, employees have an expectation of what a comprehensive health plan looks like, and generally don't like deviations from it, even if that deviation is in an effort to make their care cheaper or better. Therefore, despite the occasional story about companies drastically reducing health expenses through innovative benefit design, on average employers have bowed to the wishes of their employee bases and kept their benefits stadardized. 

But, as I mentioned above, the broad failure of employer efforts is not for a lack of trying  - and there have been a sparing number of large successes combined with a host of benefit design methods that have small, but proven effects. I'll try to briefly give an overview of the methods of benefit design that have been tried (ad some that haven't) thus far:

- Direct Contracting and Self-Insurance.
- Pooled employer consortiums to increase buyer power.
- Reference Pricing
- Use of Centers of Excellence for high-complexity cases. 
- Value Based Insurance Design (also known as 'intelligent use of cost sharing') 
- Narrowed and Tiered Networks



## Putting it All Together. 

So, given what we know about Amazon's tendencies as well as prior attempts at using benefit design to bend the cost curve, what might we expect Amazon to do?
