## About 

Hey everyone! My name is Ashwin Varma and this website is my dedicated place to analyze the strategy of the healthcare and technology businesses (as well as their intersection). I find that  while these two industries get a lot of coverage by the national media, they’re never explored in a level of detail that appeals to me as an investor or a strategist. Analogous to the method in which Stratechery transformed commentary on the technology industry, I hope to publish content that  provides a bit more context to the day-to-day bustle of the healthcare industry, context that will ideally give you a better understanding of why certain events are important and how investors think about them.

But why am I qualified to talk about these matters? This summer I was a venture analyst for Santè Ventures, a firm operating in Austin that invests in a variety of life-sciences companies, including medical device and therapeutics companies. You should head over and give their portfolio a look – they’re invested in a variety of really cool companies. Prior to that I also interned at CareSet Systems, a health-technology consulting company headed up by Fred Trotter, a legend in the health-technology community. I’m also a Venture Partner at Contrary Capital, a seed-stage fund that is attempting to find the next great university-sourced startups. We’ve already invested in some great companies like Cortex Healthcare and the Additive Rocket Corporation.  Need funding? Drop me a line at av40@rice.edu and let’s chat! And lastly, I’m currently a student at Rice University, where I’m a part of the Rice-Baylor BS-MD Program and majoring in Statistics, with a unofficial specialization in Computer Vision. If all goes well I should be at Baylor College of Medicine getting my MD soon enough!

Enjoy!
